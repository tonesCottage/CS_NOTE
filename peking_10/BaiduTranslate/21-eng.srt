1
00:00:13,128 --> 00:00:16,220
I want to be a jockey when I grow up, ya
I want to be a jockey when I grow up

2
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,641
I'm down for Heathfield and

3
00:00:18,761 --> 00:00:19,937
South of Amena...

4
00:00:20,057 --> 00:00:22,052
we are going to Africa

5
00:00:22,642 --> 00:00:24,628
and trying to teach people

6
00:00:24,748 --> 00:00:26,502
I don't think you
want to go to university

7
00:00:26,622 --> 00:00:28,328
if you want to be an astronaut

8
00:00:28,448 --> 00:00:29,537
I'd like to

9
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,940
find out all about
the moon and all that

10
00:00:42,077 --> 00:00:44,803
Is it important to fight? yes!

11
00:00:54,692 --> 00:00:57,755
I want to be a jockey when I grow up, ya
I want to be a jockey when I grow up

12
00:01:05,115 --> 00:01:08,616
Tony was already an apprentice at
Tommy Gosling's Racing Stables in Epsom

13
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:10,265
when he left school at fifteen.

14
00:01:18,072 --> 00:01:19,671
this is a photo finish of

15
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:20,967
when I rode at Newbury

16
00:01:21,087 --> 00:01:22,767
I'm the one with the white cap

17
00:01:22,887 --> 00:01:24,770
I was beaten a length
and a half for third

18
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,289
and I had a photo finish

19
00:01:27,067 --> 00:01:29,796
so I took it out the box and
kept it as a souvenir

20
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:32,301
What would you do if you don't
make it as a jockey?

21
00:01:32,421 --> 00:01:33,748
I don't know

22
00:01:34,405 --> 00:01:37,485
if I knew I couldn't be one
I'd get out of the game

23
00:01:38,612 --> 00:01:39,959
I wouldn't bother

24
00:01:40,312 --> 00:01:42,584
What do you think you would do then?

25
00:01:43,143 --> 00:01:44,284
learn taxis

26
00:01:45,701 --> 00:01:47,661
Tony didn't make it as a jockey.

27
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:51,322
He had three races, wasn't placed
and gave it up.

28
00:01:51,661 --> 00:01:53,479
At 21 he was 'doing the knowledge'

29
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:55,550
learning to be a London cabbie

30
00:01:56,113 --> 00:01:58,330
I will be a cab driver
and I know I will

31
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:02,458
and I'm going to prove every person
who think I can't be a cab driver wrong

32
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:05,511
and I'm going to get that
badge and put it right in their face

33
00:02:05,631 --> 00:02:07,527
just to tell them how
wrong they can be

34
00:02:07,647 --> 00:02:09,696
and how under estimated I am

35
00:02:09,816 --> 00:02:12,467
it's surprising who you pick-up,
you see..

36
00:02:12,845 --> 00:02:14,795
I once met Kojak, I picked him up

37
00:02:15,856 --> 00:02:18,717
and Warren Mitchell or
Alf Garnett, you know...

38
00:02:18,837 --> 00:02:22,165
and I said "oh Hello Warren, how are
you mate? good to see ya."

39
00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:25,673
so he ends up saying "I want to go
to Langan's Brasserie

40
00:02:25,793 --> 00:02:27,642
you know Stratton Street,
Langan's"

41
00:02:28,534 --> 00:02:31,900
so half way there I said listen,
I said  "Warren, it wouldn't...

42
00:02:32,609 --> 00:02:34,484
I said "It wouldn't be you
if you don't sort of..

43
00:02:34,604 --> 00:02:36,872
come out with Alf you know,
I mean.. give us a..

44
00:02:36,992 --> 00:02:38,641
let's see how he's going you know"

45
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,941
so straight away he's
brought Alf Garnett to life

46
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:42,659
in the back of me cab

47
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,093
so

48
00:02:44,593 --> 00:02:47,897
we are on the way to Langan's and all
I can hear is Alf Garnett

49
00:02:48,017 --> 00:02:50,354
"you know... it's the labour government"

50
00:02:51,149 --> 00:02:52,176
when we get there

51
00:02:52,512 --> 00:02:55,979
I said "thanks
Warren, terrific mate. 

52
00:02:57,123 --> 00:02:59,112
so he gave me exactly 

53
00:02:59,421 --> 00:03:03,039
listen, I said "I know you're
Alf Garnett and you're having trouble.."

54
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:07,062
I said "but I want you to become
Warren Mitchell now..

55
00:03:07,182 --> 00:03:09,869
my tip is 20
odd pence or whatever..."

56
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:11,115
he said "son..."

57
00:03:11,384 --> 00:03:12,853
as Alf Garnett still

58
00:03:12,973 --> 00:03:15,861
"you know Alf's doing bad
at the moment I can't afford it"

59
00:03:15,981 --> 00:03:17,788
and he walked away and like...

60
00:03:17,908 --> 00:03:19,960
he done me like a kipper

61
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,611
What does it take to
be a good cabbie?

62
00:03:22,731 --> 00:03:25,272
I think myself, a
happy-go-lucky character

63
00:03:26,056 --> 00:03:26,898
and

64
00:03:27,275 --> 00:03:30,976
take as much as what any other person
couldn't take in a normal job because

65
00:03:31,096 --> 00:03:34,527
it's a big world out there and everyone
is a different character that I pick up

66
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:37,751
there attitudes... some of them
like the city gents, the typical

67
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:39,958
"Waterloo, driver
please, in five minutes"

68
00:03:40,078 --> 00:03:43,625
I sort of say "Hold on mate I'll get my
helicopter out of the boot."

69
00:03:43,745 --> 00:03:46,181
I love being a taxi driver
I like the outdoor life

70
00:03:46,301 --> 00:03:49,261
the independance, there's no one
to govern me or say

71
00:03:49,381 --> 00:03:51,148
"you've got to be
in at a certain time."

72
00:03:51,268 --> 00:03:54,026
sometimes on Saturday mornings
I go to the pictures

73
00:03:54,146 --> 00:03:57,949
sometimes with my friends
and sometimes with him

74
00:03:58,386 --> 00:04:00,069
you don't!
-I do!

75
00:04:00,543 --> 00:04:01,853
she don't

76
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,421
I don't ever see ya!

77
00:04:07,222 --> 00:04:09,208
you go to different pictures

78
00:04:09,747 --> 00:04:11,699
Have you got a girlfriend?
-no

79
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:14,156
Would you like to have a girlfriend?

80
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:15,199
no

81
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,552
do you understand 'the four F's?'

82
00:04:17,672 --> 00:04:19,456
find them, feed them
and forget them

83
00:04:19,576 --> 00:04:22,500
for the other F I'll let you
use your own discrimination

84
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,543
I mean...

85
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:24,555
this one

86
00:04:24,858 --> 00:04:26,575
I tried the three F's

87
00:04:27,298 --> 00:04:28,558
but I couldn't forget her

88
00:04:28,678 --> 00:04:30,807
I used to work in a pub

89
00:04:31,403 --> 00:04:32,952
just on Friday nights

90
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:35,325
barmaids... barmaiding...

91
00:04:35,445 --> 00:04:36,385
and then

92
00:04:36,815 --> 00:04:40,367
and then from there one night
I went to a discotheque

93
00:04:40,653 --> 00:04:42,695
he was in the pub earlier on

94
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:46,314
afterwards we went to a discotheque
and Tony was standing there

95
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:49,276
and I just...
from there I just...

96
00:04:49,396 --> 00:04:50,437
that was it

97
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,078
I couldn't get rid of him

98
00:04:59,184 --> 00:05:01,456
And why did you fall
in love with him?

99
00:05:01,576 --> 00:05:02,601
I don't know

100
00:05:03,253 --> 00:05:05,676
I don't know how you've
put up with me for so long

101
00:05:05,796 --> 00:05:08,436
sometimes I don't know
how I stand him

102
00:05:08,739 --> 00:05:12,963
but what is it that  you love about...
- I like his personality

103
00:05:13,994 --> 00:05:17,427
it doesn't matter who it is
he don't change for nobody

104
00:05:17,547 --> 00:05:19,918
there's only one ambition really
I want a baby son

105
00:05:20,038 --> 00:05:22,780
if I see my baby son
that is my ambition fulfilled

106
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,053
no one know that
only you now

107
00:05:35,245 --> 00:05:38,207
we've got two children
Nicky's six and a half

108
00:05:38,712 --> 00:05:40,965
Jodi's two and a half
nearly three

109
00:05:41,085 --> 00:05:43,355
and I'm having another one
in March

110
00:05:43,475 --> 00:05:46,132
Who looks after them?
Or, do you share it up?

111
00:05:46,252 --> 00:05:47,680
me basically, yeah

112
00:05:48,859 --> 00:05:51,051
he does take them out
quite a lot

113
00:05:51,171 --> 00:05:51,825
but

114
00:05:52,968 --> 00:05:55,533
telling offs and smacks
is all left to me

115
00:05:55,886 --> 00:05:57,233
I have to do all of that

116
00:05:57,353 --> 00:05:59,219
he don't like smacking them

117
00:05:59,724 --> 00:06:01,187
he don't like telling them off

118
00:06:01,307 --> 00:06:05,378
unless it's really.. really..
- anything serious then I would

119
00:06:06,691 --> 00:06:08,677
<i>there you are...
see that baby one?</i>

120
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:11,603
So what advantages do
you think you've had over

121
00:06:11,723 --> 00:06:13,706
some of the other people we've filmed?

122
00:06:13,826 --> 00:06:18,176
well.. academically, probably they've
had more advantages over me

123
00:06:18,296 --> 00:06:21,559
either by the fact they've had
prep schools from a very early age

124
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:26,560
they've benefited by it which, you know,
it tells obviously in this film

125
00:06:26,947 --> 00:06:31,323
but as far as, you know, the stability
and the backgrounds with their parents

126
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,946
they've missed out on that

127
00:06:34,476 --> 00:06:36,965
<i>Ton.. I don't like them near me</i>

128
00:06:37,352 --> 00:06:39,001
<i>- come on
- have a piece of bread each</i>

129
00:06:39,121 --> 00:06:40,847
<i>here Jodi..</i>

130
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:41,939
<i>Jodi..</i>

131
00:06:42,059 --> 00:06:44,852
being in a prep school they're missing
the love and the care of what every

132
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:46,375
Eastender always gets

133
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,372
you know, gives their children
each time they come home from work

134
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,803
and the parents, you know

135
00:06:50,923 --> 00:06:53,984
sometimes obviously are not going to be
there cause they are away at prep school

136
00:06:54,104 --> 00:06:55,162
they're missing

137
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:57,619
the love and affection
you know, what they are craving for

138
00:06:57,739 --> 00:07:00,699
when my kids are growing up, I want to
see the change in them, all the time

139
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:03,840
so I have my own memories of when they
was a kid and how they were

140
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,489
you know
and what they were like

141
00:07:05,609 --> 00:07:08,838
<i>would everybody please sit round now
and get on with their work?</i>

142
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,548
<i>I don't want to see any backs to me</i>

143
00:07:12,575 --> 00:07:16,150
<i>there shouldn't be anyone turning around
Tony, do you hear as well?</i>

144
00:07:17,193 --> 00:07:19,734
ge<i>t on with you're work in front</i>

145
00:07:20,475 --> 00:07:21,213
<i>Tony!</i>

146
00:07:22,307 --> 00:07:23,671
<i>don't turn around again!</i>

147
00:07:24,843 --> 00:07:28,680
education is just a thing to say
"my son is higher than him"

148
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,171
or "my son had a better
background than him"

149
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:32,130
I mean

150
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:36,180
I'm as good or even better
than most of them people

151
00:07:36,719 --> 00:07:38,503
especially on this program

152
00:07:38,623 --> 00:07:39,412
I mean

153
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,408
I'm one of the tailenders you'll think
oh the Eastend boy

154
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:45,113
he ain't got a no good
education... but all of a sudden

155
00:07:45,233 --> 00:07:48,343
the Eastend boy's got a car, motorbike
and he goes to Spain every year

156
00:07:48,463 --> 00:07:49,506
and whatever

157
00:07:49,777 --> 00:07:51,493
and have I worked for it?

158
00:07:51,613 --> 00:07:53,117
no, I'm here
putting bets on

159
00:07:53,237 --> 00:07:54,784
and you think "how
does he do it?"

160
00:07:54,904 --> 00:07:57,250
and there's a boy,
who's he? and whatever

161
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,272
he's studying to be a professor,
he's making up the things

162
00:08:01,392 --> 00:08:03,811
where's the education, there's
no education in this world

163
00:08:03,931 --> 00:08:06,642
it's just one big rat
race and you've got to

164
00:08:06,762 --> 00:08:09,318
kill your man next to you
to get in front of him

165
00:08:09,438 --> 00:08:11,826
education, when I said
"there's no education"

166
00:08:11,946 --> 00:08:14,990
yes, there is an education
I made a grave mistake in saying that

167
00:08:15,276 --> 00:08:19,428
but, I didn't mean to say there's
no education as far as academically

168
00:08:19,548 --> 00:08:20,623
yes, there is

169
00:08:20,977 --> 00:08:22,456
the area, the environment

170
00:08:22,576 --> 00:08:26,411
and education makes a person have
more opportunities in this world

171
00:08:26,765 --> 00:08:29,373
you know, I mean
that's.. that's obvious

172
00:08:31,033 --> 00:08:32,531
Let's talk about the kids.

173
00:08:32,651 --> 00:08:34,921
Do you want for them what
you had for yourself?

174
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,672
In terms of schooling
and everything?

175
00:08:36,792 --> 00:08:41,569
you're talking about.. my childhood
five years old upwards to 7, 8, 9

176
00:08:41,925 --> 00:08:43,911
I had no money, my father had no money

177
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,065
I wore my brother's
clothes for ten years

178
00:08:46,185 --> 00:08:49,330
these hand-me-down's are sort of
going on my arms with holes on them

179
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:53,243
I've never had any opportunities to
better myself because I was a kid

180
00:08:53,363 --> 00:08:54,841
I never knew no better

181
00:08:55,144 --> 00:08:56,407
my mum and dad, you know

182
00:08:56,527 --> 00:08:58,999
my dad's got.. you know he's..
he couldn't work

183
00:08:59,119 --> 00:09:00,935
I'm not making a
violin story out of this

184
00:09:01,055 --> 00:09:02,803
I mean, that's the way it was

185
00:09:02,923 --> 00:09:04,195
and I'm more stronger

186
00:09:04,315 --> 00:09:07,039
it happened that way
I mean, I'm a more stronger person

187
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:08,823
I appreciate things more now

188
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:11,559
and now I'm in a position
through my job

189
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,493
you know, to give my kids the life
I never had like.. lovely clothes

190
00:09:15,613 --> 00:09:18,978
I go to holidays, you know,
I go to Portugal and I go to Spain

191
00:09:19,098 --> 00:09:21,024
hopefully America next year

192
00:09:21,495 --> 00:09:23,532
I mean, I want everything

193
00:09:23,652 --> 00:09:26,730
I never had to go, you know, on my kids

194
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:27,958
to say, you know...

195
00:09:28,078 --> 00:09:31,392
let them know the benefits of the
nice life and what's it's all about

196
00:09:31,512 --> 00:09:35,623
they're precious!
"oh yes... oh yes... oh yes..."

197
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,852
they're nuts!

198
00:09:38,148 --> 00:09:40,287
you just have to touch them...

199
00:09:40,407 --> 00:09:43,805
yeah, they.. well, they can get
what they want, can't they?

200
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,127
If you've got to work for it

201
00:09:46,396 --> 00:09:49,123
and it's them that can just
ask for money and get it

202
00:09:49,243 --> 00:09:50,798
and they can buy what they want

203
00:09:50,918 --> 00:09:53,542
I've learned through driving a cab
that people are individuals

204
00:09:53,662 --> 00:09:57,463
whatever they are.. upperclass or,
you know, middleclass or..

205
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,769
as in my case, you know, an Eastender

206
00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:00,530
but

207
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:04,182
I'm only glad, you know, that I've found
out the difference at an early age

208
00:10:04,302 --> 00:10:05,983
so i can judge people..

209
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,709
on what they are
rather than who they are

210
00:10:09,231 --> 00:10:13,470
I'm not a politician so let them worry
about what's coming for the next day

211
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:14,766
all I understand is

212
00:10:14,886 --> 00:10:19,510
dogs, prices, girls, knowledge,
roads, streets, squares and

213
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,061
mum and dad and love

214
00:10:21,181 --> 00:10:23,975
that's all I understand that's
all I want to understand

215
00:10:26,298 --> 00:10:28,570
<i>four and a half fifties,
four and a half fifties, four and</i>

216
00:10:30,691 --> 00:10:34,560
At 21 he was earning a bit extra
as a bookie's runner at Hackney Wick.

217
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,707
What do they call you here?

218
00:10:37,827 --> 00:10:39,811
I reckon a pest, or
something like that

219
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:42,098
I don't mean to make
a nuisance of myself

220
00:10:42,218 --> 00:10:44,909
I mean if for other
patrons of the place

221
00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:48,241
they don't want to see a little
boy nipping between their feet

222
00:10:48,361 --> 00:10:50,783
running, putting a
bet on here for a face

223
00:10:50,903 --> 00:10:53,644
they don't understand, they think
"cor what's he doing is he mad?"

224
00:10:53,764 --> 00:10:56,556
I mean, I walk up there
and I order the teas

225
00:10:56,676 --> 00:10:58,811
there could be eight people
in front of me, I just go...

226
00:10:58,931 --> 00:11:02,035
"can I have a tea please.. tea pleas"
five times, "tea please.. tea please.."

227
00:11:02,155 --> 00:11:04,219
and they've gotta serve me
before them or get rid of me

228
00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:05,565
do you understand?

229
00:11:05,936 --> 00:11:07,476
so that's how you've got to do it

230
00:11:08,528 --> 00:11:09,916
I'm in two golf societies

231
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:14,561
and each month, all of the members of
each society meet to play a game of golf

232
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:21,993
and who are the
guys you play with?

233
00:11:22,113 --> 00:11:25,376
well, they are mostly publicans
or taxi drivers, you know

234
00:11:25,696 --> 00:11:26,370
and..

235
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,769
we always end up, you know,
have a small bet

236
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:33,034
Do you like the whole social side of it?
- only with my mates because

237
00:11:33,154 --> 00:11:36,619
on a golf course it becomes
the very.. snooty type, you know

238
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:40,406
I mean, I understand they've got
to pay a 

239
00:11:40,894 --> 00:11:43,941
and they don't, you know, really want
anyone without any etiquitte

240
00:11:44,061 --> 00:11:47,783
to go on the golf course and ruin
their so called golf course, right?

241
00:11:47,903 --> 00:11:51,418
<i>that's good..
great shot.. great shot..</i>

242
00:11:52,059 --> 00:11:55,120
it does get a bit.. a pain sometimes
you know when

243
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,445
when they keep saying "excuse me sir,
are you a member?"

244
00:11:58,565 --> 00:12:00,095
it comes out like that

245
00:12:00,215 --> 00:12:01,811
obviously etiquette's etiquette

246
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:04,304
so you've got to conduct
yourself on these type of courses

247
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:05,769
<i>cause I think..</i>

248
00:12:06,156 --> 00:12:09,589
<i>you're a bit smaller
than most people</i>

249
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:11,323
<i>you try and hit the ball hard</i>

250
00:12:11,443 --> 00:12:13,713
<i>you've got to just..
it'll get there</i>

251
00:12:15,345 --> 00:12:17,396
<i>where'd he go?
- I'm over here</i>

252
00:12:18,767 --> 00:12:21,864
<i>oh.. I missed that one
- unlucky.. keep hold of her</i>

253
00:12:22,251 --> 00:12:24,338
<i>- it's about an eight to the..
- too much mate.. too much</i>

254
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:27,098
<i>no it ain't.. no it ain't.. no..
Ton.. hit an eight</i>

255
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,960
<i>it's definitely an eight
- no that's too much club Ken</i>

256
00:12:30,246 --> 00:12:32,855
<i>- eight, hit an eight
- no.. no.. give us a nine mate</i>

257
00:12:32,975 --> 00:12:36,541
<i>nine, I think that's about right
- if you hit a nine, hit it to the right</i>

258
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:43,845
<i>that's it.. that's it.. that's perfect..</i>

259
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,221
<i>great shot</i>

260
00:12:48,928 --> 00:12:50,426
<i>that's a great shot</i>

261
00:12:50,749 --> 00:12:53,913
<i>now I, am a young fella
and I've come to you </i>

262
00:12:54,033 --> 00:12:57,260
<i>I heard that you are a big successful
taxi driver - you want advice?</i>

263
00:12:57,521 --> 00:12:58,312
<i>- yes I...</i>

264
00:12:58,432 --> 00:13:01,544
- I've been a film
extra now for six years

265
00:13:01,964 --> 00:13:04,000
It may not go no futher
I mean I'm just..

266
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,397
having acting lessons..

267
00:13:05,517 --> 00:13:07,720
<i>- you give me the benefit
of all of your experience</i>

268
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,102
<i>alright? now you've got to feel
pretty big, bigger than me</i>

269
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:12,323
<i>- just go?
- right there! here we go!</i>

270
00:13:12,443 --> 00:13:14,730
<i>- tell me son, what do you
want to be a cab driver for mate?</i>

271
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,931
<i>- well, make a lot of money
you know, have a good life`</i>

272
00:13:17,051 --> 00:13:20,213
<i>- son, look at me, I might be a
successful business man</i>

273
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,192
<i>I might have the suit..
I might have the..</i>

274
00:13:22,312 --> 00:13:24,985
<i>all the holidays in Spain every year
but son it's hard work out there mate</i>

275
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:26,946
<i>- you're not reaching me yet
- not getting to you </i>

276
00:13:27,066 --> 00:13:30,604
<i><i>- no, you're not getting to me, alright?
now be bigger, dominate me, alright?</i>

277
00:13:30,724 --> 00:13:31,900
<i>- son!
- yeah?</i>

278
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,905
<i>son, it's a big world out
there and obviously I'm not.. </i>

279
00:13:35,025 --> 00:13:36,942
<i>I can't get into it Warren
- alright, don't worry</i>

280
00:13:37,062 --> 00:13:41,671
- when I was in The Sweeney and when I
was in Churchill: The Wilderness Years

281
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:44,108
I see the actors and
I thought, like you know

282
00:13:44,228 --> 00:13:46,307
it's not quite easy to act on stage

283
00:13:46,427 --> 00:13:49,605
cause it's you know, you need
time and dedication, it's very hard

284
00:13:49,725 --> 00:13:52,397
<i>- son! tell me why do you
want to be a taxi driver!</i>

285
00:13:52,517 --> 00:13:54,568
<i>well you know
you've got success</i>

286
00:13:54,688 --> 00:13:58,439
<i>- don't let.. don't let looks go
impressing... I mean, listen</i>

287
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:00,627
- What excites you about acting?

288
00:14:00,747 --> 00:14:02,816
I like it, I mean, I think
of me self, you know

289
00:14:02,936 --> 00:14:05,801
I can do that, I still want to have a go
of it, I mean nothing for sort of

290
00:14:05,921 --> 00:14:07,635
fame or fortune or anything like that

291
00:14:07,755 --> 00:14:09,655
big hollywood and bright lights

292
00:14:09,775 --> 00:14:11,780
it's nothing like that,
just a side line

293
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:15,449
So, what drives you then
through all of these various ambitions?

294
00:14:15,971 --> 00:14:17,907
it's a philosophy of not
keeping still, I mean..

295
00:14:18,027 --> 00:14:20,751
I'm a very overactive
type of person, I mean..

296
00:14:20,871 --> 00:14:22,839
I like to feel that I
don't want to keep still

297
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,987
because life, you know, don't wait for
nobody so you've gotta cram it in

298
00:14:26,107 --> 00:14:28,082
as much as you can
before you're days are numbered

299
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:32,020
I mean, I may be a happy-go-lucky
type of fellow, which I am

300
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:35,673
I'm an Eastender which the attitude is,
"allo' mate, alright, how are ya?"

301
00:14:35,793 --> 00:14:36,687
type of thing

302
00:14:36,807 --> 00:14:38,117
I wouldn't want to lose that

303
00:14:38,237 --> 00:14:39,952
How long are you
going to be a cab driver?

304
00:14:40,072 --> 00:14:41,955
Is this what you want to
do for the rest of your life?

305
00:14:42,075 --> 00:14:45,176
well, at the moment, I'm
very happy driving a cab

306
00:14:45,296 --> 00:14:46,085
but..

307
00:14:46,489 --> 00:14:49,350
my wife and I always considered
owing our own pub

308
00:14:49,991 --> 00:14:53,694
so obviously, I think, within
two or three years

309
00:14:54,317 --> 00:14:56,875
once I get financially
straightened out

310
00:14:57,515 --> 00:14:59,500
I'm going to have a go
at being a publican

311
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,948
and if I don't like it

312
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:03,877
say, if I give it a go for a
year or even six months

313
00:15:03,997 --> 00:15:05,863
if I don't like
being a publican

314
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:10,339
I'm in a good position to say get rid
of the pub and go back to taxi driving

315
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:13,409
I don't want to change
because if I change

316
00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:15,916
it proves that
Tony Walker was all fake

317
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:23,635
<i>fifty five to twenty, boys?</i>

318
00:15:23,755 --> 00:15:25,705
- What are the best times for you?

319
00:15:26,883 --> 00:15:28,970
two, two really
the best..

320
00:15:29,408 --> 00:15:32,212
time is when the kids..
the first baby was born

321
00:15:32,738 --> 00:15:34,775
the next one, obviously, Jodi

322
00:15:36,121 --> 00:15:38,444
but my greatest fulfillment in life

323
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:42,135
when I.. when I rode at Kempton

324
00:15:42,255 --> 00:15:44,138
in the same race as Lester Piggott

325
00:15:44,258 --> 00:15:47,823
I was a naive, wet behind
the ears, apprentice

326
00:15:47,943 --> 00:15:50,898
and the governor told me
"you've got to ride son"

327
00:15:51,018 --> 00:15:53,658
"Friday, you've got to lose
x-amount of weight"

328
00:15:53,778 --> 00:15:56,536
which I did.. eight pounds in four days

329
00:15:58,545 --> 00:16:01,692
and he says like, I go in there,
and they're all there, you know

330
00:16:01,812 --> 00:16:03,038
I'm part of it

331
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:07,717
all my years, from seven, all my
ambition is fulfilled in one moment

332
00:16:07,837 --> 00:16:11,781
when the longfellow comes out
and I'm in with him, like in the same..

333
00:16:11,901 --> 00:16:14,289
the starter is calling
out to register the names

334
00:16:14,409 --> 00:16:18,732
and he'll sortta go like "Piggott,
draw, eight.. Walker, draw, sortta ten"

335
00:16:19,385 --> 00:16:23,256
and your idol, like, you're there
and the big man's there, I mean

336
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:28,574
money in the whole world couldn't
buy that proudest day of my life

337
00:16:28,694 --> 00:16:32,106
which.. my ambition
fulfilled to the highest level

338
00:16:33,907 --> 00:16:34,563
and

339
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,054
I eventually finished last

340
00:16:37,174 --> 00:16:40,572
tailed off obviously, but
it didn't make any difference to me

341
00:16:40,692 --> 00:16:43,618
just to be part of it,
be with the man himself

342
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:48,769
couldn't buy it, that was the
proudest day of my whole life

343
00:16:50,257 --> 00:16:52,367
We are going to Africa...

344
00:16:53,141 --> 00:16:55,262
and trying to teach people...

345
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:57,029
who are not civilized

346
00:16:57,685 --> 00:16:58,611
to be..

347
00:16:58,731 --> 00:16:59,924
more or less..

348
00:17:00,044 --> 00:17:00,834
good

349
00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:02,921
no,  don't want to be
a missionary because

350
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:05,396
I just can't talk
about it to people

351
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,695
you know.. I am interested
in it myself but..

352
00:17:09,048 --> 00:17:11,033
I wouldn't be very good at it, at all..

353
00:17:11,741 --> 00:17:12,379
<i>- Yes Sir! </i>

354
00:17:12,935 --> 00:17:15,039
<i>Mohan Ali
- Yes Sir!</i>

355
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,469
<i>Kasim Mahir
- Yes Sir!</i>

356
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:17,731
<i>Oscar Ali
- Yes Sir!</i>

357
00:17:17,851 --> 00:17:20,054
<i>Nasril - Yes Sir!
Sultan - Yes Sir!</i>

358
00:17:21,063 --> 00:17:22,056
<i>Abdul Khair</i>

359
00:17:22,176 --> 00:17:24,514
- I was working at an
insurance company at the time

360
00:17:24,784 --> 00:17:28,234
and I decided to go into teaching
without any experience at all

361
00:17:28,354 --> 00:17:31,915
and I didn't think they'd allow somebody
to walk off the street into a classroom

362
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:36,916
6 times 3 is 18, shared by 2 is 9,
plus 7 is 16, so you put a 16 there

363
00:17:37,036 --> 00:17:40,303
- they were crying out for
most teachers, they interviewed me

364
00:17:40,423 --> 00:17:43,232
they phoned me up the next day
and said "would I like the job?"

365
00:17:43,352 --> 00:17:45,538
I said "yes,"
within five weeks..

366
00:17:45,841 --> 00:17:47,389
I was in a classroom

367
00:17:48,926 --> 00:17:52,595
they took one look at me and
thought it was christmas, I think

368
00:17:55,523 --> 00:17:57,997
What's the most enjoyable
thing about teaching?

369
00:17:58,117 --> 00:18:01,286
just being a part of
the pupils advancement

370
00:18:01,406 --> 00:18:04,686
and learning and watching
them understand more

371
00:18:04,806 --> 00:18:06,487
and being more confident

372
00:18:06,607 --> 00:18:10,139
then, getting some enjoyment
and satisfaction from mathematics

373
00:18:13,825 --> 00:18:16,249
After working in
the city for three years,

374
00:18:16,369 --> 00:18:20,423
Bruce Started teaching at Tony's
old school in the east end of London.

375
00:18:20,878 --> 00:18:25,001
He lives in a local council flat
within walking distance of the school.

376
00:18:26,015 --> 00:18:29,128
<i>Holden, let's hear the
present tense of 'evasto'</i>

377
00:18:30,021 --> 00:18:32,158
<i>Evasto, evastas,  evas..</i>

378
00:18:34,026 --> 00:18:34,935
evastant

379
00:18:35,055 --> 00:18:38,220
evastamus, evastatis, evastant

380
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,530
yes, speak up

381
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,634
they don't, sort of, enforce..

382
00:18:42,441 --> 00:18:44,108
being upper class and..

383
00:18:44,781 --> 00:18:47,938
things like that..
at St. Paul's, you know they..

384
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:51,809
suggest that you don't have long
hair and they do get it cut if..

385
00:18:51,929 --> 00:18:52,684
and..

386
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:56,452
they teach you to be
reasonably well mannered

387
00:18:56,572 --> 00:18:59,532
but not too sniff on the poorer people

388
00:19:00,912 --> 00:19:05,616
When we filmed him at 21, Bruce was in
his last year at Oxford reading maths.

389
00:19:07,339 --> 00:19:10,705
<i>and you can show
that this is irreducible</i>

390
00:19:11,523 --> 00:19:15,461
<i>then you do a transformation
on this polynomial, x=t+2 </i>

391
00:19:15,581 --> 00:19:19,635
<i>- good, that's a nice way of doing it,
particularly using Eisenstein down here </i>

392
00:19:19,755 --> 00:19:21,698
<i>because his test is very powerful
- yes</i>

393
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,213
It's so different from
your own education

394
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,940
where you're teaching now, why?

395
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:35,880
general education is..
better for society, I think

396
00:19:36,335 --> 00:19:38,109
public schools are divisive

397
00:19:38,229 --> 00:19:40,331
that's with no statement
about my education

398
00:19:40,451 --> 00:19:42,940
my education was
academically excellent

399
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,976
and I am very grateful for it

400
00:19:45,632 --> 00:19:49,044
I think there is a class society
and I think..

401
00:19:49,308 --> 00:19:50,637
public schools may..

402
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,145
help its continuance

403
00:19:53,265 --> 00:19:55,013
<i>- see you're in the lead, you see..</i>

404
00:19:55,133 --> 00:19:59,691
<i>because DSE Cabs have got profit of 

405
00:19:59,961 --> 00:20:01,812
okay? now can you
explain that just to Abdul

406
00:20:01,932 --> 00:20:04,791
because I want him to
understand what it is..

407
00:20:06,786 --> 00:20:08,349
I don't know whether..

408
00:20:08,469 --> 00:20:11,211
I said, "right, I must
do something which is

409
00:20:11,331 --> 00:20:14,308
against what I've been
brought up to do" or whatever...

410
00:20:14,428 --> 00:20:17,926
I don't know, I just found
something I find rewarding

411
00:20:18,246 --> 00:20:21,290
I didn't agree with the conservatives
about what they're doing with the

412
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:24,437
black people, you know racial policy

413
00:20:26,238 --> 00:20:30,090
Do you have to defend immigration
to a lot of people in this area?

414
00:20:31,638 --> 00:20:33,305
yes, I think you do but

415
00:20:33,978 --> 00:20:37,295
those who say "there are too
many coming in" and so on

416
00:20:37,985 --> 00:20:42,512
I think, really are uneducated
about the whole question

417
00:20:43,303 --> 00:20:46,903
they should see the positive benefits
that they are having in this country

418
00:20:47,023 --> 00:20:50,260
and see that as a
result of all of this immigration

419
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,388
they are not being denied opportunities

420
00:20:52,508 --> 00:20:56,107
it's not the fault of immigrants
that there is unemployment

421
00:20:57,497 --> 00:21:00,577
it's part of a political parties
responsibility is to explain that

422
00:21:00,697 --> 00:21:04,565
and show people what
is the more truthful way

423
00:21:04,685 --> 00:21:06,669
of representing the situation

424
00:21:07,636 --> 00:21:11,103
none of the parties
seem to agree with me

425
00:21:11,389 --> 00:21:14,352
and I think if I had voted
I'd have voted labour

426
00:21:14,654 --> 00:21:18,694
I am about the only
socialist in my village

427
00:21:19,701 --> 00:21:22,747
and I go
into the pub and..

428
00:21:23,757 --> 00:21:27,594
sort of expect to stand up
and defend all socialist policies

429
00:21:28,604 --> 00:21:30,850
sort of, this is
the village socialist

430
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:33,728
no, village
idiot, sorry

431
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,063
I just see their lack
of opportunities for

432
00:21:39,551 --> 00:21:42,647
a lot of people, obviously,
unemployment is a great

433
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:46,063
feature in many people's lives
and many family's lives

434
00:21:46,183 --> 00:21:47,006
and..

435
00:21:47,393 --> 00:21:50,069
teaching children, sometimes
you wonder

436
00:21:50,189 --> 00:21:52,358
what's going
to happen to them?

437
00:21:53,317 --> 00:21:54,361
it seems to me that

438
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:57,491
the leader of the country at the moment
should be one of the most unpopular

439
00:21:57,611 --> 00:21:59,090
person's in the country

440
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:02,328
and yet she gets away
with everything, um..

441
00:22:02,631 --> 00:22:06,504
she.. as far as I can see
has done lots of damage

442
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:09,826
and yet..

443
00:22:10,399 --> 00:22:12,361
nobody, nobody can oppose her

444
00:22:12,481 --> 00:22:17,763
my heart's desire is to see my daddy
who is six thousand miles away

445
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:23,492
and I can remember being happy there
I can remember..

446
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:27,194
also  being miserable because
I can remember crying

447
00:22:27,565 --> 00:22:28,524
<i>- hold steady!</i>

448
00:22:28,644 --> 00:22:31,923
you know, I always seemed to be beaten
on and I could never understand why

449
00:22:32,043 --> 00:22:35,281
Did it give you an overdeveloped
sense of authority?

450
00:22:35,401 --> 00:22:38,142
if you look at society in general, I've
always probably

451
00:22:38,262 --> 00:22:40,414
been on the side of authority

452
00:22:40,869 --> 00:22:43,309
and you know, it's
been, it's been..

453
00:22:46,183 --> 00:22:49,213
an education learning
that authority can be bad

454
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:51,216
and.. can be corrupt

455
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:04,213
well my girlfriend is in Africa

456
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:08,231
and I won't... don't think I'll have
another chance of seeing her again

457
00:23:08,351 --> 00:23:10,167
Have you go a girlfriend?

458
00:23:10,287 --> 00:23:11,833
no.. not yet

459
00:23:12,674 --> 00:23:14,240
I'm sure it will come

460
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,721
but not yet

461
00:23:15,841 --> 00:23:18,259
I think I would very much like to..

462
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:25,496
become involved in a family like
my own family for a start

463
00:23:25,616 --> 00:23:30,184
that's a need I feel I ought to fulfill
and would like to fulfill

464
00:23:30,622 --> 00:23:32,052
and would do it well

465
00:23:32,172 --> 00:23:35,772


466
00:23:32,172 --> 00:23:35,788
I mean, I do think a lot of people
think too much about it

467
00:23:37,196 --> 00:23:39,889
What happened
when you burnt your fingers?

468
00:23:45,376 --> 00:23:47,699
I'd rather not talk
about it really

469
00:23:49,035 --> 00:23:51,206
well no in fact I don't
really mean that

470
00:23:51,326 --> 00:23:53,563
I don't mean I don't
want to talk about it

471
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:56,929
it's just I'd need quite a long
time to think about it really

472
00:23:57,198 --> 00:23:59,565
I think I possibly
get a little serious

473
00:24:01,215 --> 00:24:02,712
and uh..

474
00:24:03,503 --> 00:24:05,944
don't quite
understand the modern..

475
00:24:06,819 --> 00:24:07,324
sort of..

476
00:24:07,896 --> 00:24:10,283
way of behaving,
the modern manner..

477
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,044
I think I'm a
little old fashioned

478
00:24:13,164 --> 00:24:15,467
<i>at three o' clock I'm going to come
and pick you up from Arts</i>

479
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:17,083
<i>you'll only have one art lesson</i>

480
00:24:17,203 --> 00:24:19,289
<i>so if you're art teacher
forgets at five to three </i>

481
00:24:19,409 --> 00:24:21,989
<i>ask her to say we should be packing
away and I'll come and get you</i>

482
00:24:22,109 --> 00:24:24,789
So there you were, you went to a
posh preparatory school

483
00:24:24,909 --> 00:24:27,050
and a major public school and to Oxford

484
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:29,823
And now, you're in a
council flat teaching in this

485
00:24:30,147 --> 00:24:31,763
school in the Eastend of London.

486
00:24:31,883 --> 00:24:33,816
You don't feel any
sense of disappointment?

487
00:24:33,936 --> 00:24:38,748
no because what I am trying to do
at the moment and achieve is difficult

488
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:43,080
It may not sound difficult in the
sense that you could sum up what I do

489
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,259
quite simply

490
00:24:44,379 --> 00:24:47,693
But behind all of that,
it is very difficult and..

491
00:24:48,063 --> 00:24:52,067
I certainly find it
satisfying achieving successes

492
00:24:52,672 --> 00:24:54,271
there may come a time

493
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:59,190
when I decide I can't do it and that's
not necessarily a weakness that's..

494
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:02,657
that may be a strength that you realize

495
00:25:03,482 --> 00:25:05,215
you can't do it as
well as you would wish

496
00:25:05,335 --> 00:25:10,012
I think the most important thing in the
world is everyone should know about God

497
00:25:10,448 --> 00:25:12,047
It all springs from..

498
00:25:14,925 --> 00:25:16,992
having God and Christ I suppose

499
00:25:17,481 --> 00:25:20,981
that.. you try do that as
best as posttible and let that

500
00:25:21,101 --> 00:25:22,496
lead your actions in life

501
00:25:22,616 --> 00:25:26,956
Does it sadden you when you meet people
who don't believe in Christianity?

502
00:25:27,394 --> 00:25:30,582
yes, if they dismiss it
casually, if they dismiss it

503
00:25:30,927 --> 00:25:32,769
as just being something..

504
00:25:35,031 --> 00:25:38,033
"well we know about that,
we got a bit about that at school

505
00:25:38,153 --> 00:25:39,834
and it doesn't really mean very much"

506
00:25:39,954 --> 00:25:43,529
then it does sadden me because
it's much much more than that

507
00:25:44,434 --> 00:25:47,058
What is it about that's
important to you?

508
00:25:48,261 --> 00:25:50,130
well, the belief in..

509
00:25:50,752 --> 00:25:54,388
the belief in goodness
and in love as being two

510
00:25:56,348 --> 00:25:58,858
well.. great positive forces in that..

511
00:26:00,036 --> 00:26:01,483
you know people..

512
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:05,826
well, just the simple belief
like a good act is never wasted

513
00:26:12,474 --> 00:26:15,032
certainly you can observe
somebody when they are seven

514
00:26:15,152 --> 00:26:18,701
and identify particular things which
maybe are then always with them..

515
00:26:18,821 --> 00:26:20,687
whatever else happen to them

516
00:26:21,377 --> 00:26:25,593
people possible say I am little to
innocent at times or naive

517
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:29,111
I used to get worried
about this and think

518
00:26:29,397 --> 00:26:33,184
perhaps I ought not to
be taken in or deceived or..

519
00:26:33,554 --> 00:26:36,852
I'm not talking about love now, I'm
just talking about generally speaking

520
00:26:36,972 --> 00:26:37,835
but um..

521
00:26:40,259 --> 00:26:42,110
I feel that's a strength in a way

522
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,821
if there are people who
are willing to trust

523
00:26:44,941 --> 00:26:45,713
then..

524
00:26:46,251 --> 00:26:47,968
we should be encouraged

525
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:52,217
Tell me, do you
have any boyfriends Suzi?

526
00:26:53,387 --> 00:26:54,263
Ummm..

527
00:26:54,835 --> 00:26:57,107
yes
-Tell me about him?

528
00:26:58,234 --> 00:27:03,115
well, he lives up in Scotland
and I think he's thirteen

529
00:27:04,682 --> 00:27:09,412
and I'm rather lonely up there
because he usually goes to school

530
00:27:10,203 --> 00:27:15,805
but we usually play till about half
past six when he comes home from school

531
00:27:16,397 --> 00:27:18,097
then we go in and then..

532
00:27:18,972 --> 00:27:20,790
he goes home to do his homework

533
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:23,062
Have you got any boyfriends Suzi?

534
00:27:28,242 --> 00:27:32,568
What is your attitude towards
marriage? For your self?

535
00:27:37,004 --> 00:27:39,146
Well, I don't know I haven't given it a
lot of thought

536
00:27:39,266 --> 00:27:41,620
because I'm very very cynical about it

537
00:27:44,342 --> 00:27:46,901
but then, you know, you get a certain
amount of faith restored in it

538
00:27:47,021 --> 00:27:49,206
well, I mean, I've got friends who've

539
00:27:49,326 --> 00:27:52,842
and their parents are happily married
and so it does put faith back into you

540
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:55,721
but me, myself,
I'm very cynical about it

541
00:27:57,119 --> 00:27:59,357
we were friends for about two years

542
00:28:00,013 --> 00:28:02,520
Rupert and Suzi we're
married five year ago.

543
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,670
and.. I think the nice thing was
that we new each other very well before

544
00:28:08,344 --> 00:28:10,822
we knew quite a lot of
the faults of..

545
00:28:11,798 --> 00:28:12,775
each other

546
00:28:14,752 --> 00:28:16,384
which I think's very important

547
00:28:16,504 --> 00:28:20,197
I don't sort of sit down and think,
you know, analyze marriage

548
00:28:20,496 --> 00:28:22,911
it's not something I've had to
come up and think about

549
00:28:23,031 --> 00:28:24,806
or that I was going to get married

550
00:28:24,926 --> 00:28:26,716
and I have no desire to
at the moment

551
00:28:26,836 --> 00:28:29,241
I think.. twenty is far too young

552
00:28:30,436 --> 00:28:33,531
I suppose twenty-two
is considered quite young

553
00:28:34,355 --> 00:28:36,257
I felt it was the right time

554
00:28:36,695 --> 00:28:40,280
I don't see what I would have
gained by waiting another three years

555
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,338
What gave you that feeling?

556
00:28:43,819 --> 00:28:46,377
I just felt I was
doing the right thing

557
00:28:46,497 --> 00:28:48,978
which as you said
was extrodinary when..

558
00:28:49,558 --> 00:28:52,756
only eighteen months
before I was very anti it

559
00:28:53,252 --> 00:28:56,921
I came to London when
I left school after Paris

560
00:28:58,359 --> 00:29:02,197
and at the moment I could never live
in the country I am happier down here

561
00:29:02,962 --> 00:29:06,259
the country is nice for four days
and you can go for healthy long walks

562
00:29:06,379 --> 00:29:09,287
but I Imean.. I could
never live up their now

563
00:29:09,792 --> 00:29:11,912
They live in a small village near Bath

564
00:29:12,032 --> 00:29:15,043
where Rupert is a
partner in a firm of solicitors.

565
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:20,464
I had seven years up in London I suppose
it was fantastic but I just had enough

566
00:29:20,808 --> 00:29:24,716
it's a much slower way of life down
here and I'd had enough of the rat race

567
00:29:24,836 --> 00:29:27,863
when I get married I'd
like to have two children

568
00:29:27,983 --> 00:29:30,944
I'm not very children minded at the
moment

569
00:29:31,064 --> 00:29:33,249
and I don't know if I ever will be

570
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:36,071
What do you think about them?

571
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,007
well, I don't like babies

572
00:29:39,269 --> 00:29:40,868
What was the biggest shocks to you

573
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:42,534
when you were suddenly confronted

574
00:29:42,654 --> 00:29:46,624
with a small baby that you
had to be responsible for?

575
00:29:46,744 --> 00:29:48,148
panic set in, I think

576
00:29:48,268 --> 00:29:50,790
that I wasn't going
to be able to cope

577
00:29:52,137 --> 00:29:56,275
Do you want a nanny to look after them?
Or, do you want to look after them?

578
00:29:56,395 --> 00:29:58,547
I want a nanny to look after them

579
00:29:59,103 --> 00:30:02,703
I felt that we'd taken the decision to
bring a child into this world

580
00:30:02,823 --> 00:30:06,691
and I feel that I wanted to bring
him up, not somebody else

581
00:30:06,811 --> 00:30:09,855
I thought it's my
responsibility to start him off

582
00:30:10,124 --> 00:30:14,012
whether that will make a difference
to how he turns out, I don't know

583
00:30:14,132 --> 00:30:15,865
I just felt I wanted to do it

584
00:30:15,985 --> 00:30:17,396
Is it everything you wanted?

585
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:20,552
for the moment, yes
I mean, I don't think I'll have any more

586
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:23,623
the reason, that I'll
get pleasure out of these two

587
00:30:23,743 --> 00:30:25,626
but I can't see me
going on and on and on

588
00:30:25,746 --> 00:30:27,520
with sort of four or five children

589
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,492
I think I'd feel that I'd want to move
on and try and do something else

590
00:30:32,266 --> 00:30:37,955
when I leave this school I'm
down for Heathfield and South of Amena

591
00:30:38,537 --> 00:30:42,424
and then maybe I may want
to go to a university

592
00:30:42,544 --> 00:30:44,495
but I don't know which one yet

593
00:30:45,065 --> 00:30:46,311
I'd like to do..

594
00:30:47,489 --> 00:30:49,660
a course on typing
or something like that

595
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:52,841
I left school when I was
sixteen and went to Paris

596
00:30:54,877 --> 00:30:57,537
went to secretarial
college and got a job

597
00:30:58,126 --> 00:31:01,425
What made you decide to
`leave school and go to Paris?

598
00:31:02,468 --> 00:31:06,216
I just wasn't interested in school
and just wanted to get away

599
00:31:07,933 --> 00:31:09,953
And why did you choose Paris?

600
00:31:11,842 --> 00:31:13,726
I don't know, it was my parents really

601
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,338
now I've got to a stage in my life
where I've got to make my own decisions

602
00:31:20,781 --> 00:31:24,029
you've got to learn
to fend for yourself one day

603
00:31:30,018 --> 00:31:33,199
I went to prep school
boarding when I was nine

604
00:31:33,654 --> 00:31:36,818
Rupert went at eight
and the both of us hated it

605
00:31:37,768 --> 00:31:39,417
I hated my prep school

606
00:31:39,537 --> 00:31:42,901
I just feel it's too
young to send a child off

607
00:31:43,021 --> 00:31:46,503
and we both feel that we
would never send Thomas and Oliver off

608
00:31:47,087 --> 00:31:49,460
probably maybe until they're thirteen

609
00:31:51,194 --> 00:31:53,264
I think eight is much too young

610
00:31:54,105 --> 00:31:56,461
so we will definitely keep them at home

611
00:31:56,581 --> 00:32:00,415
Do you still want to send them
in the private sector to school?

612
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,367
I think we will, yes

613
00:32:03,007 --> 00:32:05,767
but.. as I said not
until they are thirteen

614
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:10,622
Why do you choose the
private sector opposed to the state?

615
00:32:15,796 --> 00:32:18,192
I suppose it's what
we had, it's what we know

616
00:32:23,342 --> 00:32:26,859
I think both of us
probably were very sheltered

617
00:32:26,979 --> 00:32:30,327
it's only having been abroad
that you can appreciate more

618
00:32:30,447 --> 00:32:33,643
that people are very different
cultures are different

619
00:32:33,963 --> 00:32:38,137
but I think as I was growing up I
think probably I was far too sheltered

620
00:32:38,257 --> 00:32:41,091
What do you think
about making this program?

621
00:32:44,749 --> 00:32:48,300
I think it's just ridiculous, I
don't see any point in doing it

622
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:52,676
I've been very lucky up to a certain
point but everyone has their bad times

623
00:32:53,383 --> 00:32:56,395
I'm really just beginning
and I'm really young and..

624
00:32:56,833 --> 00:32:59,473
and I'll probably have a lot worse
that what I've been through now

625
00:32:59,593 --> 00:33:01,482
when you're a child
you always think how nice

626
00:33:01,602 --> 00:33:04,225
it would be to be
grown up and independent..

627
00:33:04,705 --> 00:33:07,769
but there are times
when I wish I was three again

628
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,522
It just seems a miracle to me that when
I last saw you at twenty one you were..

629
00:33:11,642 --> 00:33:16,320
nervous, you were chain smoking,
you were uptight and now you seem happy.

630
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:20,373
What's happened to you
over these past seven years?

631
00:33:21,787 --> 00:33:23,083
I suppose Rupert

632
00:33:24,177 --> 00:33:26,011
I'll give you some credit

633
00:33:26,887 --> 00:33:28,486
I'm now chain smoking

634
00:33:32,082 --> 00:33:35,061
no, I didn't know where
I was going at twenty one

635
00:33:35,819 --> 00:33:40,498
I mean, I suppose I thought I was
reasonably happy at twenty one

636
00:33:41,004 --> 00:33:43,714
but I had no kind of direction, no..

637
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:47,232
I obviously hadn't
found what I'd wanted

638
00:33:47,352 --> 00:33:49,386
I don't think most people
have at twenty one

639
00:33:49,506 --> 00:33:51,355
you're still very very young

640
00:33:53,654 --> 00:33:57,576
As a teenager Suzi spent her school
holidays on her father's estate

641
00:33:57,696 --> 00:33:58,838
in Scotland

642
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,619
What sort of things do you do?

643
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:04,819
ride, swim, play tennis, ping-pong

644
00:34:07,107 --> 00:34:08,639
I might play croquet

645
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:11,067
things like that

646
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,601
What about the social life?

647
00:34:17,395 --> 00:34:19,735
what in Perthshire? it's quite fun

648
00:34:20,713 --> 00:34:23,423
well with any child going
through their parents

649
00:34:23,543 --> 00:34:25,930
spitting up at age fourteen,
you're at a very vulnerable age

650
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:28,371
age and it does cut you up but..

651
00:34:30,113 --> 00:34:32,436
nut you know,
you get over it, it's not..

652
00:34:32,556 --> 00:34:36,264
There's no point in them staying
together for me, because it was worse

653
00:34:36,384 --> 00:34:37,846
I mean, the rides...

654
00:34:38,604 --> 00:34:39,698
it's worse

655
00:34:40,068 --> 00:34:43,215
if two people can't live together
there's no point making themselves

656
00:34:43,973 --> 00:34:46,170
my father died three years ago

657
00:34:46,725 --> 00:34:51,084
it's very hard to describe to somebody
how you just take the loss

658
00:34:51,454 --> 00:34:55,611
It is terribly hard and even now I still
can't believe my father's not here

659
00:34:56,588 --> 00:35:01,216
it's still sinking in I think
even after two and a half years.

660
00:35:01,873 --> 00:35:03,270
he was off in Scotland

661
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:06,686
It was in that very bad winter of '81

662
00:35:06,806 --> 00:35:10,209
and we were literally snowed in
and I couldn't get out

663
00:35:10,329 --> 00:35:13,494
and it was three weeks before
Thomas was born and..

664
00:35:14,251 --> 00:35:16,896
and I wasn't allowed to fly,
no airline would take me

665
00:35:17,016 --> 00:35:19,067
and the trains were
blocked from the snow

666
00:35:19,187 --> 00:35:21,087
and so I couldn't get there

667
00:35:22,282 --> 00:35:23,393
and I feel..

668
00:35:24,792 --> 00:35:27,703
I still feel guilty that
I didn't try and um..

669
00:35:28,511 --> 00:35:31,187
get myself out of here to go, but..

670
00:35:31,995 --> 00:35:34,383
you know, when you're
told you could endager a

671
00:35:34,503 --> 00:35:37,691
babies life, you have to
rather sit.. sit still

672
00:35:38,394 --> 00:35:42,389
the death of one of your close family is
probably something you don't ever

673
00:35:42,509 --> 00:35:44,695
get over and it's a different kind of

674
00:35:44,957 --> 00:35:46,892
problem than anything else

675
00:35:49,084 --> 00:35:51,508
and it is hard to come to terms with

676
00:35:52,029 --> 00:35:54,773
And it was really
last year that it sunk in

677
00:35:55,345 --> 00:35:57,634
that he really wasn't around anymore

678
00:35:58,038 --> 00:35:59,805
What do you want most out of life?

679
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:04,436
to be happy, and get on with life

680
00:36:04,556 --> 00:36:07,432
I mean, I don't want to just sit back
and let it all whiz past

681
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:10,639
I mean, you don't know how long you've
got your life for

682
00:36:11,077 --> 00:36:13,164
you know, you could get run over
by a bus tomorrow

683
00:36:13,284 --> 00:36:15,671
so you've got to make the most of it
while you've got it

684
00:36:15,791 --> 00:36:19,037
Do you have any fears
for the future? For yourself?

685
00:36:22,219 --> 00:36:25,686
no, not so much for myself at all

686
00:36:26,848 --> 00:36:30,803
I feel if I was going to have fallen by
the wayside, I'd have done it by now

687
00:36:30,923 --> 00:36:32,840
I think probably I'm..

688
00:36:33,479 --> 00:36:35,835
too staid now to do that

689
00:36:38,495 --> 00:36:39,542
but maybe I'm wrong

690
00:36:41,628 --> 00:36:42,571
when I grow up

691
00:36:42,691 --> 00:36:44,220
I'd like to..

692
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:47,519
find out all about the moon and all that

693
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:53,000
At seven, Nick, a farmer's son was at a
one room village school in the Dales.

694
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,395
I said I was interested
in physics and chemistry

695
00:36:56,515 --> 00:36:58,044
well, I'm not going to do that here

696
00:36:58,164 --> 00:37:00,973
At 14, he was going to
a Yorkshire boarding school,

697
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:03,716
and at 21, was
reading physics at Oxford.

698
00:37:04,225 --> 00:37:06,060
<i>- plug it in
- we'll give it a whirl</i>

699
00:37:06,363 --> 00:37:07,995
So what career are you going to pursue?

700
00:37:08,115 --> 00:37:12,607
It depends on whether I'll be good
enough to do what I want to really do

701
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,839
I would like, if I can,
to do research

702
00:37:25,122 --> 00:37:29,245
He is now in America, an assistant
professor at the University of Wisconsin

703
00:37:29,365 --> 00:37:31,315
earning 30,000 dollars a year

704
00:37:33,907 --> 00:37:36,267
<i>The gas in these experiments
is at a temperature</i>

705
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:38,034
<i>comparable with that of the sun</i>

706
00:37:38,154 --> 00:37:40,593
<i>whereas in a power reactor it would be
maybe 10 times</i>

707
00:37:40,713 --> 00:37:46,029
<i> the temperature of the sun and we're
trying to induce that gas to fuse</i>

708
00:37:47,065 --> 00:37:51,001
<i>the fusion reaction gives off energy and
produces the power that would </i>

709
00:37:51,121 --> 00:37:55,461
<i>be turned into electrical energy
and sent out to the consumer</i>

710
00:37:55,581 --> 00:37:56,820
<i>how hot is it in there?</i>

711
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:00,017
<i>in there, it's at
about ten million degrees</i>

712
00:38:01,482 --> 00:38:03,401
Nick is a Nuclear Physicist.

713
00:38:03,521 --> 00:38:06,485
He's using these high
temperatures to fuse atoms.

714
00:38:06,605 --> 00:38:09,615
To try to produce energy
which is free from radioactivity.

715
00:38:09,735 --> 00:38:12,914
<i>..has to be precisely coordinated
with the positive..</i>

716
00:38:13,034 --> 00:38:17,930
I finished my degree in physics
and I went on to do a p.h.d.

717
00:38:18,856 --> 00:38:20,830
and having got the p.h.d.

718
00:38:21,285 --> 00:38:25,863
after it took two and a half years to
get that which was relatively quick

719
00:38:25,983 --> 00:38:27,512
I went to work at

720
00:38:28,118 --> 00:38:30,859
the United Kingdom Atomic Energy
Authorities Cullum Laboratory

721
00:38:30,979 --> 00:38:33,148
which is where
they do fusion research

722
00:38:33,268 --> 00:38:36,868
and that is what I've been
aiming to do throughout my p.h.d.

723
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,298
but I..

724
00:38:40,089 --> 00:38:43,825
but I found when I got there that I got
a big shock when I found that my

725
00:38:43,945 --> 00:38:46,905
standard of living
went down when I started work

726
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:50,909
so when some people here offered
me a job I thought this might be

727
00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:54,325
a good opportunity to go somewhere else
where the research environment

728
00:38:54,445 --> 00:38:55,840
was a bit more vigorous

729
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:00,752
so I came here in
November of 1982, into a blizzard

730
00:39:02,296 --> 00:39:05,237
the university is substantially
different from an English university

731
00:39:05,357 --> 00:39:06,701
for several reasons

732
00:39:06,821 --> 00:39:08,158
it's a much bigger university

733
00:39:08,278 --> 00:39:11,255
Oxford had 10,000 people,
this has 40,000 people

734
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:24,473
I guess the mixture of people who
come here are different

735
00:39:24,593 --> 00:39:27,873
a far bigger fraction of the population
go to university here

736
00:39:27,993 --> 00:39:32,840
Oxford is full of people who really are
trying to prove something, I suppose

737
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,807
or be something

738
00:39:34,927 --> 00:39:38,375
a lot of people with social or
intellectual pretensions

739
00:39:38,495 --> 00:39:40,497
you're less aware
of that sort of thing here

740
00:39:40,617 --> 00:39:42,400
On the other hand, the American system

741
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,984
is much more like
the comprehensive system

742
00:39:46,104 --> 00:39:49,367
England would set out to try and be;
it takes many more people

743
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:52,172
and gets a huge section
of the population

744
00:39:52,292 --> 00:39:54,000
to a level where they're really

745
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:58,190
technically very competent and can go
out and make Silicon Valley work

746
00:39:59,673 --> 00:40:01,424
Do you have a girlfriend?

747
00:40:05,396 --> 00:40:07,806
I don't want to answer that

748
00:40:08,226 --> 00:40:12,400
I don't want to answer
those kinds of questions

749
00:40:12,787 --> 00:40:15,355
I thought that one would come up
because when I was...

750
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:20,067
when I was doing the other onensomebody
said "what do you think about girls?"

751
00:40:20,187 --> 00:40:23,904
I said, "I don't answer questions like
that" is that the reason you're asking?

752
00:40:24,024 --> 00:40:25,311
oh, I thought so

753
00:40:28,725 --> 00:40:32,866
the best answer would be to say that
I dont answer questions like that but..

754
00:40:32,986 --> 00:40:37,628
It's what I said when I was seven and
it's still the most sensible but I mean

755
00:40:38,251 --> 00:40:39,261
what about them?

756
00:40:39,381 --> 00:40:44,647
Nick was only 17 when I first met him
and I knew he was a nice person

757
00:40:45,456 --> 00:40:47,846
I find him very attractive, and..

758
00:40:49,672 --> 00:40:53,928
he uses intelligence in his relationship
with me which is very important

759
00:40:54,048 --> 00:40:56,200
a lot of people can be very bright..

760
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,011
Nick and Jackie met while they
were students at Oxford

761
00:40:59,131 --> 00:41:02,617
Jackie is doing a post-graduate
course in Business Studies

762
00:41:03,526 --> 00:41:06,404
What about you Nick?
Why did you marry Jackie?

763
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,491
Because she's..

764
00:41:08,929 --> 00:41:12,360
I find her attractive,
she's bright and independent and..

765
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:15,137
If you've been somebody who..

766
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:18,840
that had fixed ideas of
a woman's role in marriage

767
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,660
that meant dinner on the
table at 6 every evening..

768
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,807
didn't I tell you about that?

769
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:29,271
I think we would've had problems
or if one of us had not wanted children

770
00:41:29,391 --> 00:41:30,346
when I grow up

771
00:41:30,466 --> 00:41:31,600
I'd like to..

772
00:41:32,088 --> 00:41:34,832
find out all about the
moon and all that

773
00:41:35,185 --> 00:41:37,952
Where did you get
all this brain-power from?

774
00:41:38,844 --> 00:41:42,732
all this brain-power?
I don't know, did it just happen?

775
00:41:42,852 --> 00:41:44,936
all this brain-power..
that's a hard one to answer

776
00:41:45,056 --> 00:41:47,799
because first I have to accept that
I've got all this brain-power

777
00:41:47,919 --> 00:41:51,451
and that's not the sort of thing
I tend to go around saying

778
00:41:51,571 --> 00:41:57,244
but I've always been interested in,
from a very early age in..

779
00:41:58,725 --> 00:42:01,148
technical or scientific things

780
00:42:01,451 --> 00:42:06,767
when I was very young,
I had a picture-book about "the planets"

781
00:42:06,887 --> 00:42:10,066
and I thought this was wonderful
and I've just been..

782
00:42:10,453 --> 00:42:15,550
interested in that sort of thing and
reading technical or scientific material

783
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:17,116
for a long, long time

784
00:42:18,758 --> 00:42:22,242
I was the only child
my age in my village

785
00:42:22,362 --> 00:42:27,367
but I mangaged to spend my time
talking to adults who were around

786
00:42:27,822 --> 00:42:30,346
If one is wandering down a country lane

787
00:42:30,666 --> 00:42:33,998
there is an awful lot to look at
in the world around you

788
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:37,197
I remember looking
at various natural phenomena

789
00:42:37,317 --> 00:42:40,967
and being intrigued to try and
understand what made them tick1

790
00:42:41,303 --> 00:42:46,035
one time I was particularly wrapped
up in how a particular cloud

791
00:42:46,155 --> 00:42:48,930
which was a very unusual shape
you know, and how did that work?

792
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:53,248
and that was the sort of thing that
made me want to go further into

793
00:42:54,211 --> 00:42:55,524
natural sciences

794
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:59,041
I think that if I'd been in a city I'd
probably would've had more interaction

795
00:42:59,161 --> 00:43:02,315
with people and
might have developed more..

796
00:43:03,409 --> 00:43:05,564
skills in dealing with other kids

797
00:43:05,684 --> 00:43:09,710
trying to become a reasonably
well-adjusted person was for me

798
00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:14,035
a bit of a struggle for awhile
I was given a fantastic opportunity

799
00:43:14,155 --> 00:43:17,515
when I went to university
and that really saved my bacon

800
00:43:17,635 --> 00:43:18,965
They'd like to..

801
00:43:19,385 --> 00:43:22,280
to come out for a holiday
in the country, we we like..

802
00:43:22,718 --> 00:43:25,427
when I'd like to have
a holiday in the town

803
00:43:25,714 --> 00:43:30,720
I've been to Leeds a couple of times
and.. I haven't been to Manchester

804
00:43:35,069 --> 00:43:37,374
I went to London with the other...

805
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:41,481
when you did the first program
but that's the only time I've been..

806
00:43:49,972 --> 00:43:51,672
What attracts you about America?

807
00:43:51,792 --> 00:43:54,631
it's an exciting place to be,
there's a lot going on

808
00:43:55,034 --> 00:43:57,172
in terms of research, and other things

809
00:43:57,292 --> 00:44:00,033
but I really came
here to do research but..

810
00:44:00,153 --> 00:44:04,532
there are more opportunities and
just a general feeling of more going on

811
00:44:04,652 --> 00:44:06,664
than I had previously

812
00:44:06,784 --> 00:44:10,502
this place is less hidebound,
less bureaucratically tied down

813
00:44:11,297 --> 00:44:15,235
so it's much easier to go out
and get things done than in England

814
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,820
Do you get lonely here?

815
00:44:19,543 --> 00:44:21,544
You just tend to get
stuck here into your

816
00:44:21,664 --> 00:44:24,152
everyday routine
and you don't think about it

817
00:44:24,272 --> 00:44:28,562
when you call home,
then you realize how far away you are

818
00:44:28,682 --> 00:44:34,019
and now it seems acute because
our families are getting older

819
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:37,048
even if you think in
terms of seeing them

820
00:44:37,907 --> 00:44:39,489
once every two years

821
00:44:40,455 --> 00:44:43,350
- that's not so many times, is it
- you're thinking only about ten times

822
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:47,137
and that's awful, when you think
in those terms and realize...

823
00:44:47,257 --> 00:44:48,955
you really are in exile

824
00:44:50,151 --> 00:44:52,905
Does this put a pressure
on your relationship?

825
00:44:53,175 --> 00:44:55,127
no, I think it binds us together

826
00:44:55,247 --> 00:44:57,332
because we just have
one another over here

827
00:44:57,870 --> 00:45:00,672
In 21, some of the people were saying

828
00:45:00,792 --> 00:45:03,018
that they felt it was
immoral to emigrate

829
00:45:03,138 --> 00:45:04,367
immoral to leave.

830
00:45:04,983 --> 00:45:07,642
Do you have any feelings about that
since you're the one whose left?

831
00:45:08,282 --> 00:45:09,376
in my position

832
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:13,497
I don't feel that
I'm letting England down

833
00:45:13,617 --> 00:45:16,981
because I don't think that England
particularly wanted me there

834
00:45:17,101 --> 00:45:18,798
doing what I was doing

835
00:45:18,918 --> 00:45:20,381
It had trained me marvelously

836
00:45:20,501 --> 00:45:22,906
I'd gone through a wonderful
educational system

837
00:45:23,026 --> 00:45:26,963
particularly Oxford was
a fantastic experience socically

838
00:45:27,083 --> 00:45:31,238
again, it was a great place to try
and develop emotionally

839
00:45:31,738 --> 00:45:35,322
and the academic standards there are
absolutely superb

840
00:45:35,693 --> 00:45:38,789
having trained in a
very academic fashion there

841
00:45:38,909 --> 00:45:43,195
and I then went out to try and do
something with all that training and

842
00:45:43,315 --> 00:45:46,537
found that society just wasn't terribly
interested in what I was trying to do

843
00:45:46,657 --> 00:45:49,949
so how could I feel that I'm betraying
a country when it doesn't want me to do

844
00:45:50,069 --> 00:45:52,298
to do what it's trained me to do?

845
00:45:54,368 --> 00:45:56,858
a really big issue
for us at the moment is

846
00:45:56,978 --> 00:46:00,948
how we're going to manage to have kids
and run two careers

847
00:46:01,267 --> 00:46:03,129
we don't want to

848
00:46:03,398 --> 00:46:06,915
miss out on the chance
of having a significant career,

849
00:46:07,035 --> 00:46:09,760
and we don't want to miss out
on the chance to have kids

850
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:12,142
and to be involved with them

851
00:46:12,262 --> 00:46:14,885
but in those early formative years,
would you be happy for your children

852
00:46:15,005 --> 00:46:16,804
to be brought up by Jackie

853
00:46:16,924 --> 00:46:19,834
and Jackie not be able to give them
her full attention?

854
00:46:19,954 --> 00:46:23,967
well it's not.. that's putting it in a
rather  strange way - it's not just me

855
00:46:24,087 --> 00:46:25,600
I.. this is...1

856
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:28,983
this is an area...I pay lip service to
the idea of equal shares on this as well

857
00:46:29,103 --> 00:46:32,096
and it remains to be seen if
I would actually live up to my intention

858
00:46:32,216 --> 00:46:34,344
there are several things, I think,
to be said here

859
00:46:34,464 --> 00:46:38,585
if we both work in academia,
that will make life much easier because

860
00:46:38,705 --> 00:46:43,174
as things are at the moment in the
States, if you have a computer at home

861
00:46:43,294 --> 00:46:47,146
you can come in to teach and to give
office hours to your students

862
00:46:47,266 --> 00:46:49,090
but you can work

863
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:51,194
half of the day from home

864
00:46:51,682 --> 00:46:55,189
but I don't want to be the person
left behind while Nick flies in

865
00:46:55,309 --> 00:46:58,810
and shares an adult life
with his children

866
00:46:58,930 --> 00:47:01,525
at college and working,
I want to be there to

867
00:47:01,645 --> 00:47:02,619
Is she difficult?

868
00:47:02,739 --> 00:47:03,958
at times, yes

869
00:47:04,833 --> 00:47:08,452
whenever we have an argument she does
have a tendency to explode, I suppose

870
00:47:08,572 --> 00:47:12,006
to get, no to get really
miserable about it, and not..

871
00:47:12,126 --> 00:47:15,019
we've only been married four years

872
00:47:15,456 --> 00:47:16,904
anything could happen

873
00:47:17,024 --> 00:47:20,894
we could easily drift apart
there are so many pressures on people

874
00:47:21,483 --> 00:47:23,637
you just have to work at it

875
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:27,172
and that's why it's important
that you have the same ideas

876
00:47:27,292 --> 00:47:29,596
that you want the same kind of life

877
00:47:30,017 --> 00:47:34,948
when we were in England,
our big source of arguments was money

878
00:47:35,068 --> 00:47:39,981
we were always squabbling about money
but that one, mercifully..

879
00:47:40,101 --> 00:47:42,542
it seems to have gone away pretty well,
we still disagree

880
00:47:42,662 --> 00:47:44,983
but it isn't a major source of rows

881
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:48,955
A person with one million pounds
is not going to be muvh

882
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:52,993
is not goint to be more unhappy
than a person with two million pounds

883
00:47:53,113 --> 00:47:55,130
I've never really been
aiming for money

884
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:59,388
and that's curiously enough
why it was such a surprise that..

885
00:48:00,684 --> 00:48:04,801
it really surprised me when I found that
my standard of living mattered to me

886
00:48:04,921 --> 00:48:07,679
when I finished University and I found
that I couldn't afford

887
00:48:07,799 --> 00:48:11,163
what I'd been able understood I
could afford as a student

888
00:48:11,612 --> 00:48:13,918
It suddenly caught up with me
for the first time in my life

889
00:48:14,038 --> 00:48:16,173
that I really did care about how much
moneyI was getting

890
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:18,563
and it didn't ever occur to me
that I would

891
00:48:18,683 --> 00:48:22,100
if I could change the world,
I'd change it into a diamond

892
00:48:22,622 --> 00:48:25,696
I'd like to think, I'm hoping
that I might do at some stage

893
00:48:25,816 --> 00:48:28,432
but I don't really think that I've done
anything that you can call

894
00:48:28,552 --> 00:48:30,300
a great success, I mean..

895
00:48:31,836 --> 00:48:35,976
It would seem really ridiculous to any
of my friends who watch this if I said

896
00:48:36,096 --> 00:48:38,416
"Christ, aren't I a
great success, look at me"

897
00:48:38,536 --> 00:48:42,523
When I first met you, I remember
I thought this was very idealistic

898
00:48:42,643 --> 00:48:44,021
but it was rather interesting

899
00:48:44,141 --> 00:48:45,636
when I asked you why
you're working on fusion

900
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,791
you said that you
wanted to save the world

901
00:48:47,911 --> 00:48:50,068
It was a - I think that's
a bit embarrasing now

902
00:48:50,188 --> 00:48:52,778
but I don't think you'd feel
the same way about something that

903
00:48:52,898 --> 00:48:54,629
you didn't feel mattered

904
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:55,831
that's right

905
00:48:55,951 --> 00:48:58,810
I picked it because I thought it really
was something that could be

906
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:00,476
useful to people

907
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:01,948
hopefully.. eventually..

908
00:49:25,965 --> 00:49:28,894
yes, it would be a
disappointment if I didn't..

909
00:49:29,819 --> 00:49:33,653
achieve very much
but I'm not worrying about it very much

910
00:49:34,225 --> 00:49:36,043
I've just got to go out
and make it happen

911
00:49:37,861 --> 00:49:39,746
I don't think you want
to go to university

912
00:49:39,866 --> 00:49:42,013
if you want to be an astronaut

913
00:49:42,133 --> 00:49:42,975
What?

914
00:49:43,917 --> 00:49:46,123
changed my mind
completely of course

915
00:49:46,243 --> 00:49:47,924
I think it was just the

916
00:49:48,614 --> 00:49:50,515
imagination a 7 year old has

917
00:49:50,635 --> 00:49:53,612
I might be living in
cloud cuckoo land, you know

918
00:49:54,869 --> 00:49:56,821
mum and dad might say, "no son"

919
00:49:57,107 --> 00:50:00,019
"that's not life,
you don't get a job you like"

920
00:50:01,029 --> 00:50:02,644
I'd like to think I could

921
00:50:02,764 --> 00:50:05,384
teachers are undervalued

922
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:08,532
The whole system
is beginning to crumble

923
00:50:08,652 --> 00:50:11,847
you know, people outside
of it don't realize that, but it is

924
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:13,188
and it's ..

925
00:50:13,558 --> 00:50:16,722
very disillusioning, you know,
you don't feel you're getting anywhere

926
00:50:16,842 --> 00:50:19,011
and of course the money as well

927
00:50:19,131 --> 00:50:22,310
which, whatever the papers
tell you, is abysmal

928
00:50:22,984 --> 00:50:25,340
Peter left his comprehensive
school in Liverpool

929
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:28,555
and at 21 was studying
history at London University

930
00:50:28,675 --> 00:50:30,305
living in student digs

931
00:50:31,145 --> 00:50:32,323
the facts were

932
00:50:32,878 --> 00:50:37,002
that I'm particularly an intelligent
person, just reasonably, I suppose

933
00:50:37,122 --> 00:50:39,644
I'm not a genius, I just went to college

934
00:50:39,764 --> 00:50:41,711
on three reasonable A levels

935
00:50:42,317 --> 00:50:46,743
and just didn't do very much work for
three years, just did the bare minimum

936
00:50:46,863 --> 00:50:49,571
turned up to lectures,
wrote a few essays

937
00:50:50,075 --> 00:50:52,314
you get a degree for it
and it was a joke really

938
00:50:52,434 --> 00:50:57,077
once Carolyn Stepford said she
loved me

939
00:50:58,466 --> 00:51:02,794
and I'm going to marry her
wehn I grow up

940
00:51:03,314 --> 00:51:07,005
doesn't appeal to me at all
at the moment.. I've just gone twenty

941
00:51:07,746 --> 00:51:10,608
I haven't even been abroad
yet in my life so..

942
00:51:11,062 --> 00:51:13,685
there's no way I'm
going to get settled down

943
00:51:13,805 --> 00:51:16,866
what was it about Peter
that you fell in love with?

944
00:51:18,852 --> 00:51:21,461
who said anything about
love? I don't..

945
00:51:23,638 --> 00:51:28,384
we have a very much the same
attitude, much the same general attitude

946
00:51:29,058 --> 00:51:32,232
to life, even though we're
very different in personality

947
00:51:32,352 --> 00:51:34,403
and in the things we like to do

948
00:51:35,716 --> 00:51:38,897
what is it about his
personality that attracted you?

949
00:51:39,893 --> 00:51:41,761
nothing really, I don't know..

950
00:51:42,804 --> 00:51:43,596
not..

951
00:51:44,168 --> 00:51:45,497
not a great deal

952
00:51:47,281 --> 00:51:49,416
Peter and Rachel have
been married four years

953
00:51:49,536 --> 00:51:51,790
and met at teacher training college

954
00:51:52,059 --> 00:51:53,860
they have just bought their first home

955
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:56,695
a terraced house in
the center of Leicester

956
00:51:57,082 --> 00:51:58,715
they both have careers

957
00:51:59,035 --> 00:52:01,458
Peter teaches in a comprehensive school

958
00:52:01,578 --> 00:52:04,134
Rachel in a college of further education

959
00:52:04,254 --> 00:52:07,878
there are two risks, either for
one of us to follow the other around

960
00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:11,496
and therefore, perhaps become frustrated

961
00:52:12,068 --> 00:52:14,237
and dissatisfied that you didn't

962
00:52:14,357 --> 00:52:17,856
initially follow your own line,
or your own individual wants

963
00:52:18,916 --> 00:52:22,433
or there's the risk that you take that
you perhaps do have to part sometimes

964
00:52:22,553 --> 00:52:24,403
for jobs or whatever

965
00:52:24,523 --> 00:52:26,796
or, for what you particularly want to do

966
00:52:27,502 --> 00:52:30,700
I think the latter risk
is much more worth taking

967
00:52:31,954 --> 00:52:33,822
So you would be prepared to part?

968
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:36,426
Yeah, I mean obviously
there is an element of compromise

969
00:52:36,546 --> 00:52:37,940
otherwise why get married?

970
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:40,212
And do you have any plans for children?

971
00:52:40,332 --> 00:52:41,795
not at the moment, no

972
00:52:41,915 --> 00:52:45,060
but us, we haven't really
thought abou it seriously

973
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:46,322
Why's that?

974
00:52:47,137 --> 00:52:49,981
well, it's because we've
both got you know..

975
00:52:50,435 --> 00:52:54,374
things we'd still prefer to be doing
you know, if you have children..

976
00:52:54,494 --> 00:52:56,360
that immediatlely limits you

977
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:58,108
I don't want to be limited yet

978
00:52:58,228 --> 00:53:02,282
if you choose to have a family, then you
also have a responsibility to children

979
00:53:02,402 --> 00:53:05,665
so you know...
it's a very difficult decision

980
00:53:07,466 --> 00:53:10,541
and although I think most liberated men

981
00:53:10,661 --> 00:53:13,016
would say that they too are
involved in that decision

982
00:53:13,136 --> 00:53:16,652
I think ultimately the responsibility
still comes down on the woman's head

983
00:53:16,772 --> 00:53:18,309
is Peter liberated?

984
00:53:19,538 --> 00:53:23,594
well I think a lot of men such as Peter
like to think they're liberated

985
00:53:23,714 --> 00:53:25,580
and I'm not in any way..

986
00:53:27,488 --> 00:53:28,751
saying that he's not

987
00:53:28,871 --> 00:53:31,326
but I think when it comes to the crunch

988
00:53:31,814 --> 00:53:33,278
you know, the absolute crunch...

989
00:53:33,398 --> 00:53:36,812
are you going to give up your job
to look after these children?

990
00:53:36,932 --> 00:53:39,279
then I think it more often than not

991
00:53:39,561 --> 00:53:42,826
that decision is made by the woman
rather than the man

992
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:47,470
if you do have children,
would you want them educated

993
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:49,708
in the way that you've been educated?

994
00:53:49,828 --> 00:53:51,122
I don't know how things have changed

995
00:53:51,242 --> 00:53:54,387
but basically you've still got this
emphasis on just getting through exams

996
00:53:54,507 --> 00:53:56,710
you know, which isn't really education

997
00:53:56,830 --> 00:54:00,994
cause most of the stuff you come
out of school with is absolutely useless

998
00:54:01,263 --> 00:54:02,643
you don't need it

999
00:54:02,763 --> 00:54:05,588
So how would you bring
them up?  Educate them?

1000
00:54:06,598 --> 00:54:09,358
well I don't know,
I suppose the easy answer is..

1001
00:54:09,478 --> 00:54:11,311
teach them more relevant things

1002
00:54:11,431 --> 00:54:12,893
get them to think for themselves

1003
00:54:13,013 --> 00:54:15,624
a bit more, which schools
don't do enough

1004
00:54:16,954 --> 00:54:20,808
Would you contemplate putting them
into the private sector of education?

1005
00:54:20,928 --> 00:54:21,852
no.. no

1006
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:23,818
definitely not

1007
00:54:23,938 --> 00:54:24,609
Why?

1008
00:54:24,729 --> 00:54:27,924
well it's just the principle,
that's all there is to it.

1009
00:54:28,665 --> 00:54:30,247
What is the principle?

1010
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:32,394
well, the principle is that
the private schools help

1011
00:54:32,514 --> 00:54:34,700
to keep the old class system going

1012
00:54:35,532 --> 00:54:37,955
they're part of it, they perpetuate it

1013
00:54:38,578 --> 00:54:40,925
so I'm certainly not
going to be involved in that

1014
00:54:41,045 --> 00:54:43,584
when I came through school
at the end, perhaps of the..

1015
00:54:44,342 --> 00:54:47,317
well, lets say the ideals of
the 60's were still there

1016
00:54:47,437 --> 00:54:49,198
even though it was the 70's

1017
00:54:49,318 --> 00:54:51,453
and, that one was always led to believe

1018
00:54:51,573 --> 00:54:53,708
that there were golden opportunities

1019
00:54:53,828 --> 00:54:55,139
but of course there aren't

1020
00:54:55,795 --> 00:54:59,279
and very much now, people of my
generation are beginning to realize

1021
00:54:59,399 --> 00:55:02,578
what perhaps sixteen-year-olds
know, now at sixteen

1022
00:55:02,698 --> 00:55:05,742
I'm only just beginning
to see that now at 27

1023
00:55:06,618 --> 00:55:08,166
that in fact, you know, there aren't..

1024
00:55:08,286 --> 00:55:12,256
there's no such thing as sort of,
mobility, in any sense of the word

1025
00:55:12,376 --> 00:55:14,191
you know, it's very difficult to move up

1026
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:18,719
do you think you've had as fair
opportunity as other people? - oh god no

1027
00:55:22,436 --> 00:55:23,497
In what way?

1028
00:55:25,028 --> 00:55:28,176
a lot of people have got it made
for them still, haven't they?

1029
00:55:28,296 --> 00:55:30,211
they've got it all lined up

1030
00:55:31,608 --> 00:55:32,298
how?

1031
00:55:34,133 --> 00:55:34,806
well..

1032
00:55:37,261 --> 00:55:38,489
like the public school..

1033
00:55:38,609 --> 00:55:41,081
I don't want to slag off people
who are in the program with m

1034
00:55:41,201 --> 00:55:43,067
not slag them off personally

1035
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:46,127
but I mean, they had it set up
for them, didn't they?

1036
00:55:46,247 --> 00:55:48,921
it's a big problem, it caused
a lot of discussion I think

1037
00:55:49,041 --> 00:55:52,961
the workers do tend to take a few
liberties as regards to strikes

1038
00:55:53,081 --> 00:55:55,409
I would like to think that
democracy is here to stay

1039
00:55:55,529 --> 00:55:58,119
perhaps we haven't got a full democracy,
in fact, we problably haven't

1040
00:55:58,239 --> 00:55:59,095
it's a..

1041
00:55:59,869 --> 00:56:01,249
it's a pretty good system

1042
00:56:01,369 --> 00:56:04,009
are you surprised by the way
England is being governed?

1043
00:56:04,129 --> 00:56:07,963
I'm not surprised with the people
who govern us at the moment, no

1044
00:56:10,807 --> 00:56:13,289
- Why?
- I've even stopped being amazed

1045
00:56:13,786 --> 00:56:14,459
Why?

1046
00:56:14,770 --> 00:56:15,510
why?

1047
00:56:16,116 --> 00:56:16,806
well..

1048
00:56:17,126 --> 00:56:19,415
I don't want to get dragged into party
politics, you know

1049
00:56:19,535 --> 00:56:21,065
but basically it's the most..

1050
00:56:21,185 --> 00:56:24,861
incompetent, uncaring,
bloody.. we've ever had

1051
00:56:25,181 --> 00:56:28,735
Well if I can't be an astronaut,
I'd like to be

1052
00:56:28,855 --> 00:56:32,719
a Bradwell sergeant in the
police force, like my dad is

1053
00:56:33,168 --> 00:56:34,902
Do you want to be rich?

1054
00:56:36,046 --> 00:56:37,293
I wouldn't mind

1055
00:56:37,413 --> 00:56:39,700
I think once I can get myself going

1056
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:41,787
I can work solid, yeah

1057
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:44,227
but it's the motive

1058
00:56:44,347 --> 00:56:46,297
which is very hard to acquire

1059
00:56:47,024 --> 00:56:47,866
yeah..

1060
00:56:49,212 --> 00:56:50,424
I'm dead lazy

1061
00:56:52,309 --> 00:56:54,699
- yeah..
- And how did you deal with it?

1062
00:56:55,069 --> 00:56:55,995
not much

1063
00:56:58,116 --> 00:57:01,280
I'm just hard to get.. you know I'm not
the sort of person who can get

1064
00:57:02,172 --> 00:57:03,888
charged up very quickly

1065
00:57:04,528 --> 00:57:05,805
I am really lazy, you know

1066
00:57:05,925 --> 00:57:09,188
if I've got things to do I'd sooner make
a cup of tea first and read the paper

1067
00:57:09,308 --> 00:57:12,251
he always looks on the negative side
of life before he looks on the positive

1068
00:57:12,371 --> 00:57:13,836
whereas perhaps I'm the opposite

1069
00:57:13,956 --> 00:57:16,529
 and that in a sense
is an area of conflict, yes

1070
00:57:16,649 --> 00:57:18,683
yeah, a clash of personalities

1071
00:57:19,491 --> 00:57:22,083
- yeah
- And how did you deal with that?

1072
00:57:23,537 --> 00:57:27,577
well, as you deal with all people
like that, you just give them a good..

1073
00:57:27,697 --> 00:57:29,361
kick and say, you know..

1074
00:57:29,849 --> 00:57:32,272
"wake up to it"
you know, that kind of thing

1075
00:57:32,912 --> 00:57:35,927
and do you see any areas of
conflict in the future for you?

1076
00:57:36,047 --> 00:57:37,375
In personality?

1077
00:57:38,317 --> 00:57:39,984
no.. no I don't
not really

1078
00:57:40,104 --> 00:57:43,486
because I think we both appreciate
each other's personalities,

1079
00:57:43,606 --> 00:57:46,322
in fact, it would be quite
dull to be exactly the same

1080
00:57:46,442 --> 00:57:48,578
I mean, there is something quite

1081
00:57:48,698 --> 00:57:50,581
exciting in being different

1082
00:57:51,321 --> 00:57:53,223
in that it isn't as predictable

1083
00:57:53,343 --> 00:57:56,286
you know, we're not along
the same track all the time

1084
00:57:56,406 --> 00:57:57,666
on the grass..

1085
00:57:58,861 --> 00:58:01,201
- we play international wrestling
- yeah

1086
00:58:01,321 --> 00:58:03,069
that's only in summertime though

1087
00:58:03,189 --> 00:58:05,558
What have been for you the best times?

1088
00:58:10,075 --> 00:58:12,785
Tommy Smith scoring
the second goal in Rome

1089
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:15,795
definitely.. one of the all-times

1090
00:58:16,738 --> 00:58:18,202
Which game was that?

1091
00:58:18,322 --> 00:58:19,919
"Which game was that?"

1092
00:58:20,844 --> 00:58:23,217
that was the European Cup final, 1977

1093
00:58:27,442 --> 00:58:30,169
you know, after that it was all..
nothing else compares with it really

1094
00:58:30,289 --> 00:58:32,676
so, it's hard to think of anything else

1095
00:58:33,876 --> 00:58:37,326
oh, I'll tell you what was another
good moment, I was um...

1096
00:58:37,446 --> 00:58:39,026
a group I played in..

1097
00:58:39,146 --> 00:58:42,359
were doing quite well...
a few occasions, that was good

1098
00:58:42,479 --> 00:58:43,655
Tell me about that.

1099
00:58:44,378 --> 00:58:47,578
It's just a local band,
I was in till fairly recently

1100
00:58:47,932 --> 00:58:51,365
you know, just played pubs and that,
but it was very enjoyable

1101
00:58:51,485 --> 00:58:54,041
You know, when you get
a good reaction from people

1102
00:58:54,161 --> 00:58:57,207
it's just one of the best
things you can have really

1103
00:58:57,327 --> 00:58:59,160
Do you ever get that in your work?

1104
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:00,371
no, god no.

1105
00:59:01,886 --> 00:59:02,576
Why?

1106
00:59:03,552 --> 00:59:05,452
well, what are you asking?

1107
00:59:05,572 --> 00:59:07,825
If they applaud at the
end of each lesson or something?

1108
00:59:07,945 --> 00:59:10,770
No, just that excitement,
that communication?

1109
00:59:11,073 --> 00:59:12,419
no.. no I don't

1110
00:59:19,081 --> 00:59:20,613
Do you think people change much?

1111
00:59:20,733 --> 00:59:22,414
Or, do you think we saw

1112
00:59:22,534 --> 00:59:24,611
you, the man
as a 7 year old boy?

1113
00:59:24,731 --> 00:59:28,871
I thought for awhile that was a
bit too simple, but I think it's true

1114
00:59:29,679 --> 00:59:32,507
because after that
your barriers begin to go up

1115
00:59:32,978 --> 00:59:36,165
you learn how to fend off things
like I was just saying

1116
00:59:36,285 --> 00:59:39,463
obviously when 7 seven you don't think
about it, you just come out with it

1117
00:59:40,752 --> 00:59:43,092
so yeah, to a point you
reflect that

1118
00:59:43,212 --> 00:59:46,054
So the boy at 7,
is in a sense, the real you?

1119
00:59:48,242 --> 00:59:50,379
Yeah, it's sort of..

1120
00:59:51,178 --> 00:59:53,769
the essential..
the essential Peter Davies

1121
01:00:01,913 --> 01:00:04,842
There were nine other children filmed
in 1963.

1122
01:00:05,397 --> 01:00:06,611
What of them?

1123
01:00:07,099 --> 01:00:12,031
If we did all um, love Geoffery,
and we all want to marry him -Yeah

1124
01:00:12,151 --> 01:00:15,094
I think I know the one that he'd
likes.. best..

1125
01:00:15,414 --> 01:00:16,336
and that's her

1126
01:00:16,456 --> 01:00:21,335
and I wasn't talking today
and Brown sent me out for nothing

1127
01:00:21,455 --> 01:00:25,946
I feel like rumbling when there'
already been a fight

1128
01:00:26,066 --> 01:00:30,131
If I can't be an astronaut,
I think I'll be a coach driver.

1129
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:32,554
I read the Financial Times

1130
01:00:32,674 --> 01:00:34,187
What's happened to these children?

1131
01:00:34,307 --> 01:00:36,206
Where are they and what are they doing?

1132
01:00:36,326 --> 01:00:37,923
We'll see tomorrow night.

1133
01:01:44,310 --> 01:01:49,309
If someone comes up and starts fighting
then.. I think it serves them right

1134
01:01:49,429 --> 01:01:53,180
I know the one he likes.. best..
and it's her!

1135
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:56,580
I think it's not a bad idea
to pay for school

1136
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:58,263
I'm going to work in Woolworth's

1137
01:01:58,383 --> 01:02:01,941
I'd just walk around,
and see what I can find

1138
01:02:02,403 --> 01:02:04,406
I think I'll be a coach driver

1139
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:16,170
I don't like um..

1140
01:02:16,290 --> 01:02:17,483
the big boys..

1141
01:02:17,786 --> 01:02:19,116
hitting us and..

1142
01:02:19,236 --> 01:02:23,071
and a prefect sending
us out.. out for nothing

1143
01:02:25,091 --> 01:02:27,430
I know I prefer to be alone really.

1144
01:02:28,171 --> 01:02:29,383
when I said that

1145
01:02:29,503 --> 01:02:32,196
I know.. I know
even now, I meant that

1146
01:02:32,316 --> 01:02:35,159
if someone dropped me out
in the Sahara desert

1147
01:02:35,279 --> 01:02:37,743
I probably would have been happy
more or less, if you get the point

1148
01:02:57,384 --> 01:02:59,925
say you had a wife

1149
01:03:00,045 --> 01:03:02,349
say, say, say..

1150
01:03:02,469 --> 01:03:05,244
say you had to eat
what they cooked you and..

1151
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:08,526
and say I don't like greens,
well I don't.

1152
01:03:10,209 --> 01:03:11,772
and say, she said

1153
01:03:12,176 --> 01:03:14,684
"you have to eat, what you get"

1154
01:03:15,105 --> 01:03:19,060
well I don't like greens..
so she gives me greens.. and it..

1155
01:03:20,238 --> 01:03:21,151
and that's it..

1156
01:03:21,271 --> 01:03:24,282
I find it hard to express
emotion most of the time

1157
01:03:24,402 --> 01:03:26,587
though I'm getting on top of that

1158
01:03:26,941 --> 01:03:28,422
more now, you know?

1159
01:03:29,044 --> 01:03:33,098
Just the simple things to say to Susan,
I love you, something like that

1160
01:03:33,788 --> 01:03:35,976
I mean, I can tell you about it, but

1161
01:03:36,096 --> 01:03:38,636
I really haven't been able to
say it freely

1162
01:03:39,578 --> 01:03:41,009
to Sue, you know?

1163
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:43,599
Has he proposed to you?

1164
01:03:45,383 --> 01:03:49,456
yeah, it was strange, we went off and
bought the engagement ring first

1165
01:03:49,892 --> 01:03:53,678
and then I said to him, you haven't
really proposed to me yet -tongue tied

1166
01:03:53,798 --> 01:03:56,422
as you can gather,
he's sort of very shy

1167
01:03:56,691 --> 01:03:59,469
What was it that you fell in love with?
What is it about him?

1168
01:03:59,589 --> 01:04:01,623
his helplessness, I suppose

1169
01:04:01,743 --> 01:04:03,777
there's the motherly instinct in me

1170
01:04:03,897 --> 01:04:05,881
to pick him up, and cuddle him..

1171
01:04:06,001 --> 01:04:09,870
he's also very good looking, I think,
but he doesn't agree with me

1172
01:04:10,509 --> 01:04:13,825
and in the summer,
he's got this cute little bum in shorts

1173
01:04:24,133 --> 01:04:26,792
Paul and Susan live in
Melbourne, Australia

1174
01:04:27,331 --> 01:04:29,754
Four years ago they sold everything
they had

1175
01:04:29,874 --> 01:04:34,652
bought an old Bedford van,
and went on a trip through Central
and Western Australia

1176
01:04:35,090 --> 01:04:38,679
it took 7 months,
and they travelled 15,000 miles

1177
01:04:39,346 --> 01:04:41,147
I think it brought us closer together

1178
01:04:41,267 --> 01:04:45,429
because we really got to know each other
and relied on each other so much

1179
01:04:46,607 --> 01:04:51,808
I'd never been so relaxed in my life,
I felt a lot more confident in myself

1180
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,005
just great fun really

1181
01:04:55,125 --> 01:04:58,320
no pressures or worries,
everything was forgotten

1182
01:05:02,275 --> 01:05:04,480
when we got to Perth,'
I was ready to fly home

1183
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:07,590
being together so much, it was hard

1184
01:05:08,398 --> 01:05:11,242
but then we settled down and must
have settled down really well because

1185
01:05:11,362 --> 01:05:15,635
I got pregnant and everything so
something must have been going right

1186
01:05:19,927 --> 01:05:24,757
I think it's, now, why people like to
get back to nature and like to feel that

1187
01:05:25,094 --> 01:05:27,050
that they aren't
living in the 20th Century..

1188
01:05:27,170 --> 01:05:31,207
to me, it's just like an old dream that
you wish could come true, you know

1189
01:05:31,327 --> 01:05:34,893
living next to nature,
like pioneers type of thing

1190
01:05:35,987 --> 01:05:37,799
I love the place, you know

1191
01:05:38,287 --> 01:05:41,434
I find it hard to put into words really,
what it is

1192
01:05:42,191 --> 01:05:43,773
you've got the country

1193
01:05:44,245 --> 01:05:45,801
you've got bush, the outback

1194
01:05:45,921 --> 01:05:49,285
you can do more or less anything
you want, I think, here

1195
01:05:49,405 --> 01:05:52,399
whether you can do that
in England, I don't know

1196
01:05:52,668 --> 01:05:54,820
I think this is the part
we enjoyed the most

1197
01:05:54,940 --> 01:05:56,958
because we really went out
in the middle of nowhere

1198
01:05:57,078 --> 01:05:59,634
where we had to carry our own
petrol and our own water

1199
01:05:59,754 --> 01:06:02,723
to do us for the 3 or 4
days we were out that way

1200
01:06:03,178 --> 01:06:06,544
while we were up in Carnarvon,
we went and stayed on a sheep station

1201
01:06:06,664 --> 01:06:09,523
up there with our friend
from Melbourne, Bruce

1202
01:06:09,643 --> 01:06:14,118
and It was about a million acres, just
under a million acres, the sheep station

1203
01:06:14,808 --> 01:06:19,618
Bruce from the Yanrey Station, he got
ahold of sometails from the roo-shredder

1204
01:06:19,738 --> 01:06:22,388
so we could try kangaroo tail stew

1205
01:06:22,910 --> 01:06:24,472
yeah, it was a bit rough

1206
01:06:24,592 --> 01:06:27,361
we had nothing to throw it in.
- a bit sinewy

1207
01:06:29,128 --> 01:06:31,499
It gave us our own peace of mind
that we could settle down

1208
01:06:31,619 --> 01:06:36,178
and now have a family, that we had done
something, we hadn't just been nobodys

1209
01:06:36,298 --> 01:06:38,298
and lived in suburbia all our lives

1210
01:06:38,418 --> 01:06:40,854
we'd done something
that we were proud of that..

1211
01:06:40,974 --> 01:06:43,440
you know, we'd
accomplished on our own

1212
01:06:45,762 --> 01:06:47,445
Do you want this for the children?

1213
01:06:47,565 --> 01:06:49,044
I'd love it for the children

1214
01:06:49,164 --> 01:06:51,283
I was once taught when
I was at school that

1215
01:06:51,403 --> 01:06:53,723
travel could be the best education and

1216
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:57,207
living in conditions where you
have to fend for yourself

1217
01:06:57,327 --> 01:06:59,765
and you have to use your
own initiative is very good and

1218
01:06:59,885 --> 01:07:01,229
I would like it

1219
01:07:01,633 --> 01:07:06,871
I was gonna be a policeman but I
thought how hard it would be to join in

1220
01:07:08,218 --> 01:07:12,382
I just haven't made up my mind yet,
I was gonna be a phys-ed teacher but

1221
01:07:12,651 --> 01:07:17,010
one of the teachers told me that
you had to get up into university

1222
01:07:20,208 --> 01:07:23,002
At 21, Paul was working as a junior
partner

1223
01:07:23,122 --> 01:07:25,291
for a firm of bricklayers
in Melbourne

1224
01:07:26,166 --> 01:07:28,066
I'm not great at bricklaying, right

1225
01:07:28,186 --> 01:07:31,062
but if I wasn't good enough and my boss
didn't think I was good enough

1226
01:07:31,182 --> 01:07:33,923
he would have never made me
a junior partner

1227
01:07:35,488 --> 01:07:38,096
I went out on my own
as a subcontracter

1228
01:07:39,106 --> 01:07:41,294
not long after the last show

1229
01:07:42,101 --> 01:07:45,316
then I started with a partner,
I organized everything

1230
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:47,437
I bought all the equipment
because I didn't want to

1231
01:07:47,557 --> 01:07:49,557
be dependent on someone else

1232
01:07:49,677 --> 01:07:53,294
things didn't work out between the
two of us, he was a bit lazy

1233
01:07:53,414 --> 01:07:57,232
Do you have the right temperament,
do you think? To run your own business?

1234
01:07:57,352 --> 01:08:01,238
if you're talking about employing other
people, I'm not hard enough

1235
01:08:01,358 --> 01:08:05,092
I'm a little bit slow with
working out things on the job

1236
01:08:05,212 --> 01:08:07,852
not in particular the
laying of the bricks but

1237
01:08:07,972 --> 01:08:11,943
but I am a fairly slow thinker when
you've got to work something out

1238
01:08:13,559 --> 01:08:16,755
I think it'll end up being my
job for life, probably

1239
01:08:17,310 --> 01:08:19,195
not that I want it that way

1240
01:08:19,565 --> 01:08:22,443
cause it gets harder
as you get older, I think

1241
01:08:23,782 --> 01:08:26,054
I've got twenty three..  pieces..

1242
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:28,511
and I don't know how many..

1243
01:08:28,797 --> 01:08:30,649
how many.. pieces I've got now

1244
01:08:31,137 --> 01:08:35,715
<i>26 past 10 with Doug... 15 degrees
in Melbourne... at the moment...</i>

1245
01:08:36,472 --> 01:08:39,064
They live in a working
class suburb of Melbourne.

1246
01:08:39,184 --> 01:08:41,101
Paul earns 

1247
01:08:41,875 --> 01:08:43,103
owns two cars

1248
01:08:43,373 --> 01:08:46,554
and bought his hours for 

1249
01:08:47,833 --> 01:08:50,568
we're Mr. and Mrs. average,
that's just true

1250
01:08:51,214 --> 01:08:53,385
we probably earn an average income

1251
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:55,270
just an average family

1252
01:08:55,390 --> 01:08:59,865
<i>a good fist away by Russo up towards
center wing... Robertson this time... </i>

1253
01:08:59,985 --> 01:09:02,608
Susan works part time as a hair dresser

1254
01:09:02,728 --> 01:09:04,351
and they have two children,

1255
01:09:04,471 --> 01:09:05,933
Katie and Robert.

1256
01:09:07,162 --> 01:09:09,283
Are you ambitious
for your children Paul?

1257
01:09:09,403 --> 01:09:13,902
I said something one morning, that one
day Robert would be a brain surgeon

1258
01:09:14,022 --> 01:09:17,457
that was a joke, I mean like if he was
a brain surgeon, all good and well but

1259
01:09:17,577 --> 01:09:21,378
but it would be nice to let
them go one step up from us, I think

1260
01:09:22,304 --> 01:09:25,339
put it this way, I hope he
is better at school work than I was

1261
01:09:25,459 --> 01:09:27,241
so, that he's got a choice

1262
01:09:27,678 --> 01:09:29,578
you know, because really..

1263
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:32,338
the education standard
that I got, I didn't have a choice

1264
01:09:32,674 --> 01:09:34,644
what does university mean?

1265
01:09:34,764 --> 01:09:38,347
Paul started his school life at a
children's home near London.

1266
01:09:38,467 --> 01:09:42,049
When he was eight he emigrated to
Australia with his father.

1267
01:09:42,169 --> 01:09:44,810
Were you happy at the
children's home in England?

1268
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:48,395
we didn't mind it really because
we didn't know what was going on

1269
01:09:48,515 --> 01:09:50,448
cause we were a bit young then

1270
01:09:50,568 --> 01:09:53,040
What regrets do you have about
your education then?

1271
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:54,824
I didn't work hard enough

1272
01:09:54,944 --> 01:09:56,923
I was just very lazy at school

1273
01:09:57,043 --> 01:10:01,198
you know, if you're lazy and you don't
work at school, you suffer for it

1274
01:10:01,318 --> 01:10:03,301
there needs to be
a little more discipline

1275
01:10:03,421 --> 01:10:05,472
if private schools are better..

1276
01:10:06,258 --> 01:10:09,372
you'd be far better off spending
your money sending your kids there

1277
01:10:09,492 --> 01:10:11,980
then getting a video, a new television..

1278
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:14,252
or something like that, I think

1279
01:10:17,106 --> 01:10:20,234
What else do you want for your kids,
that you didn't have?

1280
01:10:20,354 --> 01:10:23,028
a happier family life, I think

1281
01:10:23,148 --> 01:10:25,671
don't take me wrong, it wasn't miserable

1282
01:10:25,957 --> 01:10:28,294
I think it could have been better

1283
01:10:28,580 --> 01:10:31,644
I think that'd be one of the
most important things

1284
01:10:31,764 --> 01:10:35,380
well my mother and father got, well
they separated originally, I think

1285
01:10:35,885 --> 01:10:36,688
and..

1286
01:10:37,327 --> 01:10:39,044
eventually got divorced

1287
01:10:39,482 --> 01:10:43,925
I went to the boarding school for one
year and then we emigrated to Australia

1288
01:10:44,632 --> 01:10:46,315
my father got remarried

1289
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:51,127
And how do you get on
with your stepmother?

1290
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:53,635
pretty well, but like I said before

1291
01:10:53,755 --> 01:10:57,102
I'm not.. just not close..
I'm not really close to my father either

1292
01:11:01,737 --> 01:11:03,571
Do you have any regrets
about about the fact that

1293
01:11:03,691 --> 01:11:05,742
that you weren't closer to
him when you were younger?

1294
01:11:05,862 --> 01:11:08,991
yeah, I suppose... in a way I suppose

1295
01:11:09,529 --> 01:11:11,849
he was always there, you know,
I could always

1296
01:11:12,136 --> 01:11:15,687
talk to him but it was different
we were sort of..

1297
01:11:16,646 --> 01:11:19,406
we were, sort of, distant friends
I mean, we always got on fairly well

1298
01:11:19,526 --> 01:11:21,380
we didn't see much of each other

1299
01:11:23,584 --> 01:11:26,025
<i>- here's grandad.. here's grandad..
- hey!</i>

1300
01:11:27,405 --> 01:11:30,819
he said actually,
to his wife Barbara that..

1301
01:11:31,779 --> 01:11:34,286
that he missed out
on his own children

1302
01:11:34,406 --> 01:11:36,643
andthat he's not
going to miss out on these

1303
01:11:36,763 --> 01:11:39,092
divorce was something new to me
until I grew up and was

1304
01:11:39,212 --> 01:11:41,549
knew what the
meaning of it all really was

1305
01:11:41,669 --> 01:11:43,653
there were no divorces in my family

1306
01:11:43,773 --> 01:11:45,707
I think of what Paul
has been through, I mean

1307
01:11:45,827 --> 01:11:49,392
Paul doesn't say that it was very bad
but I wouldn't want that for my children

1308
01:11:49,661 --> 01:11:50,941
it does worry me

1309
01:11:51,294 --> 01:11:53,920
you know, because it happens
so much these days

1310
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:56,151
only time will tell what happens

1311
01:11:56,942 --> 01:11:59,315
divorcing your wife,
what does it get you?

1312
01:11:59,435 --> 01:12:00,898
it messes up your own life

1313
01:12:01,018 --> 01:12:03,456
it messes up the kids life, wife's life

1314
01:12:03,576 --> 01:12:08,260
I don't think half the people who get
divorced even think about it properly

1315
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:11,424
What mark has it left on you, the
fact that you were brought up

1316
01:12:11,544 --> 01:12:13,040
within a bad marriage?

1317
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:16,743
the only thing I can say, that I think
might have come from that is

1318
01:12:16,863 --> 01:12:18,678
just my lack of confidence

1319
01:12:18,981 --> 01:12:21,977
and being able to show my
feelings, really, I suppose

1320
01:12:22,549 --> 01:12:25,130
he is down on him self, he has
this excuse where he says,

1321
01:12:25,250 --> 01:12:29,001
"I'm only a bricklayer, I don't..
it's got nothing to do with me"

1322
01:12:29,368 --> 01:12:32,182
I don't know why it is,
I get really frustrated with him

1323
01:12:32,302 --> 01:12:35,258
I want to ring his neck
sometimes when he does it

1324
01:12:35,378 --> 01:12:37,109
but, he's getting better

1325
01:12:39,095 --> 01:12:41,849
So, do you feel there's
any conflict ahead?

1326
01:12:42,286 --> 01:12:44,861
If Sue wants a job and a career?

1327
01:12:45,450 --> 01:12:49,304
what's come up so far, since we've
been married, we've handled that

1328
01:12:50,903 --> 01:12:53,007
really, I think, Susan would probably be

1329
01:12:53,127 --> 01:12:57,328
the be the best one to start a..
be a businesswoman and I'll stay at home

1330
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:58,776
you know..

1331
01:13:00,526 --> 01:13:03,572
I have to push him out of the house
sometimes,I think needs a bit of extra

1332
01:13:03,692 --> 01:13:05,670
male companionship because he..

1333
01:13:05,990 --> 01:13:08,380
being a bricklayer,
he only works with one fellow

1334
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:11,797
he doesen't, we don't have a social
life with work type of thing

1335
01:13:11,917 --> 01:13:16,005
well he doesn't because it's
only just one person as well as himself

1336
01:13:16,863 --> 01:13:19,909
and his basketball,
I think he really enjoys it

1337
01:13:20,029 --> 01:13:22,451
but he doesn't really let on
how much he enjoys it

1338
01:13:25,127 --> 01:13:28,440
I suppose you could see me now,
when I was seven, in a way

1339
01:13:29,198 --> 01:13:32,900
like I think it was pretty obvious
that I wasn't going to be a doctor

1340
01:13:33,020 --> 01:13:34,903
You seemed like such a sad little boy.

1341
01:13:35,023 --> 01:13:36,916
but that's me though, ha ha

1342
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:38,885
I know I was pretty..

1343
01:13:39,188 --> 01:13:42,588
you know.. long faced sortta thing..

1344
01:13:43,379 --> 01:13:47,652
I was like that sometimes out here too,
I was always getting knocked about

1345
01:13:47,772 --> 01:13:50,109
I don't like greens, well I don't..

1346
01:13:50,229 --> 01:13:52,162
the first show I saw, was at 21

1347
01:13:52,282 --> 01:13:56,218
when I saw him at seven, I just wanted
to cry, he seemed so pathetic

1348
01:13:56,338 --> 01:13:57,043
he..

1349
01:13:58,322 --> 01:14:00,459
I suppose, I don't know

1350
01:14:00,579 --> 01:14:03,842
it's hard to say, it really
made me go to jelly inside, you know?

1351
01:14:04,313 --> 01:14:05,878
to see him like that

1352
01:14:06,838 --> 01:14:11,239
And do you think it's true that we can
see the man in the seven year old boy?

1353
01:14:11,693 --> 01:14:15,320
yes, yes it is because in that he
was a very gentle and..

1354
01:14:16,262 --> 01:14:18,416
and um.. not gentle..

1355
01:14:19,945 --> 01:14:22,133
caring person, yeah
he's always..

1356
01:14:23,076 --> 01:14:26,408
cared about other people
and always been able to work his way

1357
01:14:26,528 --> 01:14:27,468
talk his..

1358
01:14:27,588 --> 01:14:30,414
try to give an explanation for saying
something he really doesn't want to do

1359
01:14:30,534 --> 01:14:32,366
you know like, "what if I"

1360
01:14:32,787 --> 01:14:35,715
"didn't like to eat my greens"
and all that sort of thing, I mean

1361
01:14:35,835 --> 01:14:38,390
he always still does that, the
"what if", you know "what if"

1362
01:14:38,510 --> 01:14:40,444
and you know he doesn't
really want to do that

1363
01:14:40,564 --> 01:14:42,632
so he's trying to
talk himself out of it

1364
01:14:42,752 --> 01:14:43,944
yeah.. yeah..

1365
01:14:44,064 --> 01:14:46,082
Does he eat greens now?
- he loves them

1366
01:14:46,202 --> 01:14:48,281
he loves them, he loves them

1367
01:14:48,401 --> 01:14:50,317
What do you remember of England?

1368
01:14:52,875 --> 01:14:55,602
well it seemed to be raining all of the
time, I wouldn't

1369
01:14:55,722 --> 01:14:56,847
stake my life on it but..

1370
01:14:56,967 --> 01:14:59,457
-we've got a lot more than
we would have in England

1371
01:14:59,577 --> 01:15:01,611
from what other people tell us

1372
01:15:02,116 --> 01:15:03,467
but there again..

1373
01:15:04,578 --> 01:15:07,103
when it comes to work I don't

1374
01:15:07,675 --> 01:15:10,267
sit down on my backside,
I'll go and chase it

1375
01:15:10,387 --> 01:15:12,000
so it's hard to say

1376
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:15,480
but I'd say, like in general,
that.. but I've probably..

1377
01:15:16,709 --> 01:15:20,008
I've probably done better
here than I would have there

1378
01:15:44,108 --> 01:15:46,416
the family is going to
come first, but I'm still

1379
01:15:46,536 --> 01:15:49,613
I'm still going to be working
and we'll progress..

1380
01:15:50,455 --> 01:15:52,609
you know..
- I'd love for Paul to build me a house

1381
01:15:52,729 --> 01:15:54,529
and I know he'd
be happy once he'd done it

1382
01:15:54,649 --> 01:15:58,534
but he's got his children and then
to build his own home...

1383
01:15:59,157 --> 01:16:02,613
it really would be the icing on
the cake for both of us

1384
01:16:06,787 --> 01:16:08,588
I read The Financial Times

1385
01:16:09,110 --> 01:16:11,414
I read The Observer and The Times

1386
01:16:11,851 --> 01:16:13,770
what do you like about it?

1387
01:16:13,890 --> 01:16:19,486
well, I like.. I usually look at the
headlines and then read about them..

1388
01:16:20,950 --> 01:16:21,842
about it

1389
01:16:22,883 --> 01:16:26,199
I like my newspaper because I've got
shares in it..

1390
01:16:26,319 --> 01:16:30,726
and I know everyday what the shares are
- The stuff that misers like you like!

1391
01:16:30,846 --> 01:16:36,095
but on Monday's they don't
move up so I don't look at it

1392
01:16:36,215 --> 01:16:38,266
what's the point of the program?

1393
01:16:39,377 --> 01:16:41,782
the point of the program is
to reach a comparison

1394
01:16:42,303 --> 01:16:43,919
I don't think it is..

1395
01:16:44,727 --> 01:16:46,932
because we're not necessarily
typical examples

1396
01:16:47,052 --> 01:16:51,505
I think that's what people who've seen
the program might think - yes, falsely

1397
01:16:51,926 --> 01:16:54,282
- I mean..
- they tend to typecast us

1398
01:16:55,965 --> 01:16:58,572
so everything we say, they'll think

1399
01:16:58,692 --> 01:17:02,527
"oh, that's a typical result of
the public school system" - yes

1400
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:05,739
Well, do you think there is any truth
behind the ideas behind the program?

1401
01:17:05,859 --> 01:17:09,223
That certain people have
more options than others?

1402
01:17:09,343 --> 01:17:11,933
it's certainly true that more people..
more people know they have

1403
01:17:12,053 --> 01:17:14,205
more options or imagine they have

1404
01:17:14,525 --> 01:17:16,460
I think in practical terms..

1405
01:17:18,025 --> 01:17:22,315
the difference in the numerical
number of options isn't that great

1406
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:25,866
but the mere knowledge creates an
option in itself - exactly, yes

1407
01:17:25,986 --> 01:17:27,870
so I think we do have more options

1408
01:17:27,990 --> 01:17:31,725
and it is undesirable but it's
very difficult to correct

1409
01:17:31,845 --> 01:17:34,401
I don't think it is
undesirable! at all!

1410
01:17:34,521 --> 01:17:37,175
I think what is undesirable is people
who have had options

1411
01:17:37,295 --> 01:17:39,935
don't make advantage of them..
take best advantage of them

1412
01:17:40,055 --> 01:17:45,068
when I leave this school
I'm going to College Court

1413
01:17:47,820 --> 01:17:51,876
then I would be going to Westminster
Boarding School if I pass the exam

1414
01:17:53,424 --> 01:17:55,528
and then we
think I'm going to

1415
01:17:56,743 --> 01:17:58,662
Cambridge and
Trinity Hall

1416
01:17:59,150 --> 01:18:01,186
John went to
Westminster school

1417
01:18:01,657 --> 01:18:06,050
and at twenty-one was in his final
year reading law at Christ Church Oxford

1418
01:18:06,690 --> 01:18:10,783
I do believe that parents have a right
to educate children as they think fit

1419
01:18:10,903 --> 01:18:13,019
and I think someone who works

1420
01:18:13,709 --> 01:18:15,930
on an assembly line in some
of these car factories

1421
01:18:16,050 --> 01:18:19,582
and earning a huge wage could
well afford to send their children to

1422
01:18:19,702 --> 01:18:21,030
a private school

1423
01:18:21,585 --> 01:18:22,797
just because..

1424
01:18:23,706 --> 01:18:27,356
just because some sorts of people don't
put that as high on their priorities as

1425
01:18:27,476 --> 01:18:29,578
you know, have a smart car or something

1426
01:18:29,698 --> 01:18:31,479
I'm going to Charter House

1427
01:18:32,893 --> 01:18:37,766
and after that Trinity Hall, Cambridge

1428
01:18:39,314 --> 01:18:43,303
Andrew went to Charter House and
read law at Trinity Hall, Cambridge

1429
01:18:44,111 --> 01:18:47,242
and you can never be sure
of leaving your children

1430
01:18:47,578 --> 01:18:49,379
any worldly goods

1431
01:18:49,499 --> 01:18:52,829
but at least you can be sure
once you've given them a good education

1432
01:18:52,949 --> 01:18:55,270
that's something that
no one can take away

1433
01:18:55,390 --> 01:18:59,579
when I leave school,
I'm going to the Dragon School

1434
01:18:59,699 --> 01:19:03,517
I might.. and mummy is..
and I might go to..

1435
01:19:04,173 --> 01:19:07,489
after, I might go to
Charter House, Marlborough

1436
01:19:07,609 --> 01:19:08,448
and..

1437
01:19:11,241 --> 01:19:15,281
I can't.. I can't remember
all the other places

1438
01:19:15,836 --> 01:19:19,051
because mummy has got so many
places... but these're some of them

1439
01:19:19,171 --> 01:19:21,205
What about university Charles?

1440
01:19:21,325 --> 01:19:23,242
I might go to Oxford

1441
01:19:24,639 --> 01:19:27,954
Charles went to Marlborough but
didn't make it to Oxford.

1442
01:19:28,074 --> 01:19:30,479
Instead, he went to Durham University.

1443
01:19:30,866 --> 01:19:36,134
I'd say, I'm pleased I didn't
because it's very much a sort of..

1444
01:19:37,363 --> 01:19:38,978
sort of Marlborough..

1445
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:41,345
prep school..

1446
01:19:42,102 --> 01:19:44,610
Marlborough-Oxbridge conveyor belt

1447
01:19:45,401 --> 01:19:47,673
and you get shoved out at the end..

1448
01:19:48,262 --> 01:19:49,221
and you..

1449
01:19:50,187 --> 01:19:51,853
when you go to Oxbridge

1450
01:19:51,973 --> 01:19:53,923
and obviously it's not true
in all cases but

1451
01:19:54,043 --> 01:19:55,303
I think for the majority

1452
01:19:55,423 --> 01:19:59,477
they mix with the same as they
were with a school

1453
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:04,614
When they were 21, we asked them what
they thought they would be doing at 28.

1454
01:20:04,890 --> 01:20:05,580
John

1455
01:20:05,849 --> 01:20:07,431
I might be at the bar

1456
01:20:08,801 --> 01:20:09,760
Doing what?

1457
01:20:11,325 --> 01:20:13,244
perhaps chancellory practice

1458
01:20:16,055 --> 01:20:18,125
How do you see your life at 28?

1459
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:21,545
What do you want for your self then?

1460
01:20:21,815 --> 01:20:23,767
I'd quite like to be married by then

1461
01:20:23,887 --> 01:20:26,241
John has just announced his engagement.

1462
01:20:26,361 --> 01:20:30,072
He is a successful barrister in the
chancellory division of the high court.

1463
01:20:30,192 --> 01:20:33,226
At 21 these were his
thoughts about his career.

1464
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:35,363
law sort of interests me

1465
01:20:35,885 --> 01:20:37,516
I think it's sort of..

1466
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:38,879
a good life

1467
01:20:38,999 --> 01:20:39,788
it's..

1468
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:43,474
it's hard work
but you sort of

1469
01:20:43,594 --> 01:20:45,476
when you get to a certain..

1470
01:20:45,596 --> 01:20:47,782
eminence, you know you
take the work you want and

1471
01:20:47,902 --> 01:20:49,886
you take the holidays you want

1472
01:20:50,357 --> 01:20:52,646
you don't really dance to anyone's tune

1473
01:20:53,706 --> 01:20:55,717
all of which quite suits me

1474
01:20:55,837 --> 01:20:57,551
And what about Charles?

1475
01:20:58,140 --> 01:20:59,299
hard to say..

1476
01:20:59,838 --> 01:21:03,153
probably scribbling
away in some basement

1477
01:21:03,273 --> 01:21:05,897
for a some London
newspaper or something

1478
01:21:06,805 --> 01:21:10,169
Charles did scribble away
for an East London newspaper.

1479
01:21:10,472 --> 01:21:12,121
He moved on after a year

1480
01:21:12,241 --> 01:21:16,144
and joined the BBC where he now
works as and assistant producer.

1481
01:21:16,497 --> 01:21:18,036
And Andrew, what did he want?

1482
01:21:18,156 --> 01:21:21,806
I'd like to be a solicitor
and also fairly successful

1483
01:21:22,715 --> 01:21:26,300
Andrew is a solicitor working
for a large firm in the city.

1484
01:21:26,653 --> 01:21:29,968
What qualities do you think
it needs to be successful?

1485
01:21:30,826 --> 01:21:34,344
well you have to have a legal
ability in my business, obviously

1486
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:38,603
and you have to have a 'bedside manner'
as far as clients are concerned

1487
01:21:38,872 --> 01:21:42,909
cause it's no good being brilliant if
you can't communicate with your clients

1488
01:21:43,029 --> 01:21:45,989
What do you think
about girlfriends at your age?

1489
01:21:46,343 --> 01:21:49,019
I've got one but
I don't think much of her

1490
01:21:49,139 --> 01:21:51,468
The girls never.. never

1491
01:21:51,588 --> 01:21:53,521
never do what the boys want them to

1492
01:21:53,641 --> 01:21:56,281
they always start playing with dolls

1493
01:21:56,401 --> 01:21:59,243
when the boys want
to play rough and tumble

1494
01:21:59,363 --> 01:22:00,634
it's quite true

1495
01:22:00,754 --> 01:22:04,219
I don't think I financially
come from the same background

1496
01:22:05,548 --> 01:22:09,571
Andrew didn't for a 'Haughty Deb'
he went for a good 'Yorkshire Lass'

1497
01:22:09,874 --> 01:22:12,432
which I mean, obviously he
knew what he wanted

1498
01:22:13,004 --> 01:22:15,697
Andrew and Jane were
married 18 months ago.

1499
01:22:16,101 --> 01:22:18,489
I think I'm pretty down to Earth and I

1500
01:22:18,609 --> 01:22:21,855
tend to be less extravagant
then maybe some women are

1501
01:22:23,235 --> 01:22:27,407
when I go out, I don't buy lots of
expensive dresses, I just buy one or two

1502
01:22:27,979 --> 01:22:30,083
and I even let her pay for them

1503
01:22:31,463 --> 01:22:34,440
They spend their weekends
in the Sussex countryside

1504
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:36,325
where they are converting an old barn

1505
01:22:36,445 --> 01:22:39,792
which they bought with
financial help from their parents.

1506
01:22:39,912 --> 01:22:43,495
They plan to live in it
permanently when they start a family

1507
01:22:44,976 --> 01:22:47,063
During a week they have a flat in London

1508
01:22:47,183 --> 01:22:49,865
and Jane has a
full-time job as a secretary.

1509
01:22:50,555 --> 01:22:53,485
I think it's not a bad
idea to pay for schools

1510
01:22:53,805 --> 01:22:57,895
because if we didn't schools
would be so nasty and crowded

1511
01:22:58,669 --> 01:23:00,468
- yes
- so do I think so?

1512
01:23:00,588 --> 01:23:03,817
- yes - and the people
in the school's wouldn't

1513
01:23:03,937 --> 01:23:05,820
- the poor people
would come rushing in

1514
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:11,289
- the man in charge
of the school would get very angry

1515
01:23:11,409 --> 01:23:17,096
because he wouldn't be able to
pay all of the masters

1516
01:23:17,216 --> 01:23:18,745
if he didn't get any money

1517
01:23:21,741 --> 01:23:24,686
well, I never really experienced
the state system but I think you get

1518
01:23:24,806 --> 01:23:29,096
a better level of education if
you can go to a private school

1519
01:23:29,216 --> 01:23:33,400
Do you think it's bad that people
like you, opt out of the school system?

1520
01:23:34,410 --> 01:23:37,743
well, there are really
two counter arguments

1521
01:23:37,863 --> 01:23:40,250
first of all, there's the argument
that people should have a choice

1522
01:23:40,370 --> 01:23:42,371
if they've earned the money to spend it

1523
01:23:42,491 --> 01:23:46,680
and there's the other argument that if
we all went to the same sort of schools

1524
01:23:47,238 --> 01:23:51,630
those school would probably be better
because those people who had influence

1525
01:23:52,086 --> 01:23:53,971
would do their upmost to
make sure they were better

1526
01:23:54,091 --> 01:23:55,772
if they had to send their children there

1527
01:23:56,318 --> 01:23:58,035
whereas they just look back

1528
01:23:58,155 --> 01:24:01,324
and don't particularly care
what happens in the state system

1529
01:24:01,444 --> 01:24:02,906
And what do you feel about that?

1530
01:24:04,067 --> 01:24:04,825
well..

1531
01:24:05,229 --> 01:24:08,505
well, I think probably the latter choice
is fairly impractical

1532
01:24:08,625 --> 01:24:11,534
so, I suppose that one has to continue
with the idea of everyone

1533
01:24:11,654 --> 01:24:12,898
having a choice

1534
01:24:13,018 --> 01:24:16,477
once I had a talk to Grevil,
he was in my house

1535
01:24:17,470 --> 01:24:18,193
and

1536
01:24:19,489 --> 01:24:22,644
I asked Sir if he could put
him out of my house

1537
01:24:22,764 --> 01:24:25,387
because he was always getting minuses

1538
01:24:25,825 --> 01:24:28,316
looking back at our film and us at seven

1539
01:24:28,753 --> 01:24:31,715
certainly I was a fairly
precocious little brat

1540
01:24:31,835 --> 01:24:33,633
and I hope I am no longer

1541
01:24:35,131 --> 01:24:37,774
Do you still read The Financial Times?
- no

1542
01:24:45,266 --> 01:24:47,808
<i>you mustn't! no feeding it says!</i>

1543
01:24:55,624 --> 01:24:56,953
<i>stop it at once!</i>

1544
01:24:57,073 --> 01:25:00,185
- I don't think much of the accents
- neither do I

1545
01:25:00,305 --> 01:25:03,568
- neither do I
- but it doesn't prevent me liking them

1546
01:25:08,006 --> 01:25:12,214
<i>that mustn't be late there,
quite quietly...</i>

1547
01:25:14,704 --> 01:25:17,109
well yes I do feel I've
had the best of everything

1548
01:25:17,229 --> 01:25:19,550
as far as education is concerned

1549
01:25:20,003 --> 01:25:23,117
but, you know, to get
here I had to work very hard

1550
01:25:23,555 --> 01:25:25,623
But you don't deny
you've had a 'silver spoon'?

1551
01:25:25,743 --> 01:25:29,460
I think anyone who goes to really
good school has had a leg-up

1552
01:25:29,746 --> 01:25:31,648
but I mean, I wouldn't say
I'd had been

1553
01:25:33,129 --> 01:25:34,864
unduly privileged if I'd

1554
01:25:35,167 --> 01:25:35,975
missed

1555
01:25:36,901 --> 01:25:40,283
exams at my school and
had to go to a sort of grotty..

1556
01:25:40,403 --> 01:25:44,803
grotty public school
I wouldn't have thought
I'd have had any advantage at all

1557
01:25:44,923 --> 01:25:48,405
yes I much say, all this talk about
opportunities it's something I did

1558
01:25:48,525 --> 01:25:50,929
did slightly object
to in the program

1559
01:25:51,451 --> 01:25:54,344
we were shown at the age of seven
outliningsort of, the academics

1560
01:25:54,464 --> 01:25:57,962
of a career that most of us..
did in fact pursue, you know

1561
01:25:58,736 --> 01:26:00,436
you know, each sentence ended up

1562
01:26:00,556 --> 01:26:03,297
"John is at Westminster" "Andrew is
at Charter House" and everything

1563
01:26:03,417 --> 01:26:05,064
it implied that we merely sailed through

1564
01:26:05,184 --> 01:26:07,673
merely manifesting an intention
that we had at the age of seven

1565
01:26:07,793 --> 01:26:11,039
it didn't show the sleepless nights,
the sort of pouring over our books

1566
01:26:11,964 --> 01:26:15,712
you know, all of the sweet and toil
that got us to universities

1567
01:26:15,832 --> 01:26:20,929
it was presented as if it was just part
of some indestructible birth rite

1568
01:26:21,049 --> 01:26:23,252
and I thought that it was unfair

1569
01:26:23,372 --> 01:26:27,510
that it didn't show having to do
beastly jobs on the holidays, you know

1570
01:26:27,897 --> 01:26:29,780
to make ends meet and things

1571
01:26:30,588 --> 01:26:32,506
it didn't give a very real..

1572
01:26:33,449 --> 01:26:34,206
impression

1573
01:26:34,326 --> 01:26:35,208
Do you want to be rich?

1574
01:26:36,336 --> 01:26:42,360
yes, because I don't want to be tied
down to the dourness of an everyday job

1575
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:45,408
I want to have enough money
so that I can indulge in

1576
01:26:46,822 --> 01:26:50,356
the things that might interest me
like collecting paintings

1577
01:26:52,039 --> 01:26:55,050
I do believe in an
ordered and structured society

1578
01:26:56,076 --> 01:26:56,951
you know

1579
01:26:57,658 --> 01:27:00,486
we are not exactly alive for very long
and we've each got our

1580
01:27:00,606 --> 01:27:04,045
our own job to
do and our own little position to be in

1581
01:27:05,129 --> 01:27:09,387
some people have.. a better time
than others, but it..  you know..

1582
01:27:09,507 --> 01:27:11,710
but it doesn't matter that if you sweep
the streets

1583
01:27:11,830 --> 01:27:13,646
you're any less valuable than

1584
01:27:13,766 --> 01:27:16,995
than someone who i
 running a huge corporation

1585
01:27:18,543 --> 01:27:20,193
well not everyone can be at the top

1586
01:27:20,313 --> 01:27:23,492
as long as people are happy
with what they are doing

1587
01:27:23,812 --> 01:27:26,504
that's, I think, the
greatest good that can be

1588
01:27:26,624 --> 01:27:31,755
and this is what worries about these
new sort of invidious class attitudes

1589
01:27:31,875 --> 01:27:34,616
the certain sort of subversive
elements are introducing

1590
01:27:34,736 --> 01:27:36,956
that are based on envy and things

1591
01:27:38,319 --> 01:27:40,675
John declined to be interviewed at 28.

1592
01:27:41,177 --> 01:27:44,392
He felt satisfied with what was said
in the previous films

1593
01:27:44,512 --> 01:27:45,738
and had nothing more to add.

1594
01:27:53,268 --> 01:27:56,449
the rich children always
make fun of poor children

1595
01:27:57,425 --> 01:28:01,077
yes - yes, they say, "look at
that lovely little sissy over there"

1596
01:28:02,188 --> 01:28:04,208
and they throw things at them

1597
01:28:04,729 --> 01:28:08,802
I don't particularly want to be
rich but I'd like to have enough money

1598
01:28:09,913 --> 01:28:12,084
Well, what do you mean by enough?

1599
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:15,938
or, enough to have a nice house and..

1600
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:20,067
and be able to send the children
to private school if you want to

1601
01:28:20,187 --> 01:28:23,130
I really don't see how someone's
life can be a failure

1602
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:27,369
if I became a journalist
and got sacked at 30

1603
01:28:27,857 --> 01:28:30,113
it's probably because I'd grown  out of
it or I'd changed

1604
01:28:30,233 --> 01:28:33,967
so I was no longer suitable, I'd find
something else which was

1605
01:28:35,647 --> 01:28:38,979
I'd find that I enjoyed and
that my talents were suited to

1606
01:28:39,535 --> 01:28:42,531
Charles has found a career
suited to his talents

1607
01:28:42,935 --> 01:28:45,340
At the BBC he makes documentary films,

1608
01:28:46,081 --> 01:28:48,690
he decided not
to take part in this film.

1609
01:28:50,018 --> 01:28:53,334
I'm quite happy living in the society
that I am living in

1610
01:28:53,454 --> 01:28:56,683
it's a shame that more people can't
get the opportunities that I've had

1611
01:28:56,803 --> 01:28:59,123
I'm not sure how one deals with that

1612
01:28:59,864 --> 01:29:03,884
But you've been lucky haven't you? What
about those that haven't been so lucky?

1613
01:29:04,004 --> 01:29:06,058
I have been very lucky

1614
01:29:08,346 --> 01:29:10,063
we pretend we've got swords

1615
01:29:10,183 --> 01:29:10,837
and

1616
01:29:11,107 --> 01:29:13,261
we makes the noises of swords fighting

1617
01:29:13,381 --> 01:29:15,912
and when someone stabs us we go ahhhhh!

1618
01:29:16,686 --> 01:29:18,581
I think if you're healthy
and have good friends

1619
01:29:18,701 --> 01:29:20,225
you can get on perfectly well

1620
01:29:20,345 --> 01:29:22,413
but everybody would like to be rich

1621
01:29:23,171 --> 01:29:25,510
Neil was brought
up in a Liverpool suburb,

1622
01:29:25,630 --> 01:29:27,362
went to comprehensive school

1623
01:29:27,482 --> 01:29:30,745
and dropped out of Aberdeen
University after one term

1624
01:29:31,098 --> 01:29:35,237
at 21 he was working as a casual
labourer at a building site in London

1625
01:29:37,425 --> 01:29:42,339
I came to London and I contacted an
agency for squatters

1626
01:29:43,101 --> 01:29:44,667
and they were able to

1627
01:29:45,289 --> 01:29:48,285
give me the address of somebody
who was able to

1628
01:29:48,672 --> 01:29:52,340
help people who were looking
for accommodation in the London area

1629
01:29:52,460 --> 01:29:56,497
and by the process of chasing
people around I eventually managed to

1630
01:29:57,103 --> 01:29:58,517
to find this place

1631
01:29:59,543 --> 01:30:01,816
I think in questions of squatting

1632
01:30:02,697 --> 01:30:05,558
a bit of humanity
is more important than vague

1633
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:08,301
rules about who can live where

1634
01:30:08,949 --> 01:30:11,932
But you've kicked
against the stability that's..

1635
01:30:12,218 --> 01:30:14,726
-I don't think I ever had any stability

1636
01:30:15,315 --> 01:30:16,661
to be quite honest

1637
01:30:17,250 --> 01:30:20,094
I can't think of any time
in my life when I ever did

1638
01:30:20,214 --> 01:30:22,950
I don't think I've been kicking against
anything, I think I've been kicking

1639
01:30:23,070 --> 01:30:25,037
in midair the whole of my life

1640
01:30:30,238 --> 01:30:32,611
last three years I've been unemployed

1641
01:30:32,731 --> 01:30:35,455
but traveling quite
a bit, mostly in Britain

1642
01:30:35,910 --> 01:30:38,047
and abroad once or twice but..

1643
01:30:38,485 --> 01:30:40,974
but not as extensively
as I used to do

1644
01:30:43,128 --> 01:30:46,677
<i>thanks, shall I put the luggage
in here? or, do you want it in the back?</i>

1645
01:30:46,797 --> 01:30:49,766
I live off money from social security

1646
01:30:50,137 --> 01:30:53,200
which does me for my rent and my food

1647
01:30:58,452 --> 01:31:02,188
I've been moving about a bit between
differnent places, really

1648
01:31:02,308 --> 01:31:07,372
I'm a bit unsettled but I'm very
shortly moving to live in digs

1649
01:31:09,829 --> 01:31:13,511
For the last seven years Neil
has been moving around Britain.

1650
01:31:13,631 --> 01:31:16,382
He spent the summer
on a farm in North Wales

1651
01:31:16,502 --> 01:31:18,483
and when we found
him he had just arrived

1652
01:31:18,603 --> 01:31:21,007
in the Western Highlands of Scotland.

1653
01:31:21,693 --> 01:31:25,006
Do you think people like who
live off the stare are scrounging?

1654
01:31:25,126 --> 01:31:25,781
-no

1655
01:31:26,201 --> 01:31:30,224
if the state didn't give us any money,
it would probably just mean crime

1656
01:31:30,344 --> 01:31:33,018
and I'm glad I don't
have to steal to keep myself alive

1657
01:31:34,079 --> 01:31:37,530
I do it simply because I
don't want to be without any money

1658
01:31:40,456 --> 01:31:42,274
if the money runs out, well

1659
01:31:42,394 --> 01:31:44,411
then for a few days, there
is nowhere to go to

1660
01:31:44,531 --> 01:31:46,061
that's all you can do

1661
01:31:46,181 --> 01:31:49,192
I simply have to find
the warmest shed I can find

1662
01:31:53,414 --> 01:31:56,174
Neil rents whatever kind of
home he can find.

1663
01:31:57,134 --> 01:32:01,794
the last job I had was cooking in a
youth hostel, some cleaning work as well

1664
01:32:02,147 --> 01:32:04,368
I was the only person in the hostel
who could speak French

1665
01:32:04,488 --> 01:32:06,320
so I did a bit of that

1666
01:32:06,626 --> 01:32:07,717
Do you eat everyday?

1667
01:32:07,837 --> 01:32:08,525
yes

1668
01:32:09,131 --> 01:32:13,490
I'm eating better now then I was at
times when I was in Aberdeen

1669
01:32:13,978 --> 01:32:16,957
those days, sometimes I really
was short of food

1670
01:32:17,849 --> 01:32:20,408
well I'm going to take
people to the country

1671
01:32:20,528 --> 01:32:22,933
and sometimes take them to the seaside

1672
01:32:23,943 --> 01:32:27,155
and have a big loud speaker in the
motor coach

1673
01:32:27,275 --> 01:32:30,867
and tell them whereabouts we are
and what we're going to do

1674
01:32:31,894 --> 01:32:35,142
and where the road is and all about that

1675
01:32:38,077 --> 01:32:39,727
there's a lot more to do

1676
01:32:40,467 --> 01:32:44,523
in the mountains than there would be
in a suburb or a city centre

1677
01:32:45,449 --> 01:32:49,102
what I found here, in fact, is you
don't talk about the weather

1678
01:32:49,506 --> 01:32:52,485
because the weather is all around,
everyone know it's been raining

1679
01:32:52,605 --> 01:32:55,632
so you don't talk about the weather
that makes good sense to me!

1680
01:32:55,752 --> 01:32:58,607
I'm not the sort of person
who can go into a pub

1681
01:32:58,727 --> 01:33:02,966
sit down with a drink and listen to
the jukebox and talk a lot of rubbish

1682
01:33:03,403 --> 01:33:05,659
a lot of people find that very relaxing

1683
01:33:05,779 --> 01:33:07,916
but, if I'm going to talk to somebody

1684
01:33:08,036 --> 01:33:10,054
a, I have to be able to
hear myself speaking

1685
01:33:10,174 --> 01:33:13,453
and b, I have to talk about something
that actually has a meaning

1686
01:33:13,573 --> 01:33:16,971
I'm not trying to denigrate the way
most people relax

1687
01:33:17,091 --> 01:33:20,009
but I can't do that, so
I'm lost in a noisy pub

1688
01:33:20,514 --> 01:33:23,611
I'll sit in a quite
corner of a quite pub

1689
01:33:23,731 --> 01:33:26,189
and then I'll want to talk about
literature or something like that

1690
01:33:26,309 --> 01:33:28,531
which not everybody.. will want to..

1691
01:33:29,927 --> 01:33:31,863
How do people regard you here?

1692
01:33:33,394 --> 01:33:35,836
well, I'm still known as an
eccentric

1693
01:33:37,485 --> 01:33:39,370
as I have been since..

1694
01:33:40,279 --> 01:33:42,838
about the age of sixteen or so

1695
01:33:44,588 --> 01:33:46,364
Do days seem long for you?

1696
01:33:46,667 --> 01:33:47,761
they can do

1697
01:33:53,567 --> 01:33:55,649
Do you have any friends anywhere?

1698
01:33:55,769 --> 01:33:58,359
I have some good friends still
in England

1699
01:33:58,695 --> 01:34:02,701
I don't think I need to go to university
because I'm not going to be a teacher

1700
01:34:02,821 --> 01:34:04,927
I went to a comprehensive school

1701
01:34:05,650 --> 01:34:10,026
I found a much bigger course and
I found it hard to settle into at first

1702
01:34:10,146 --> 01:34:12,399
I did make an application to Oxford

1703
01:34:12,803 --> 01:34:14,332
but I didn't get in

1704
01:34:15,073 --> 01:34:17,799
well I think that's
in the past now and that's..

1705
01:34:17,919 --> 01:34:21,241
I don't whether I would have
been any happier at Oxford

1706
01:34:22,343 --> 01:34:24,716
it always had been
a dream to get into Oxford

1707
01:34:24,836 --> 01:34:26,651
I think because people
had encouraged me

1708
01:34:26,771 --> 01:34:30,060
and because I knew famous
people having been to Oxford

1709
01:34:31,928 --> 01:34:33,881
it is still something occasionally I

1710
01:34:34,001 --> 01:34:36,043
I think
about and think yes

1711
01:34:37,053 --> 01:34:38,330
I know I could have done well

1712
01:34:39,373 --> 01:34:41,780
I've been playing since I started
at the comprehensive school

1713
01:34:41,900 --> 01:34:42,706
since the first year

1714
01:34:42,826 --> 01:34:45,618
I don't think I was half as
clever as I was told I was, I think

1715
01:34:45,738 --> 01:34:48,378
unfortunately, I grew up

1716
01:34:48,498 --> 01:34:50,734
against a background of fairly..

1717
01:34:51,391 --> 01:34:54,117
of people of pretty average intellagence

1718
01:34:54,237 --> 01:34:56,440
I don't think I went to
a school of bright people

1719
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:58,846
if this was the case, I don't think
I would have been so big headed

1720
01:34:58,966 --> 01:35:01,068
I know I went to university expecting

1721
01:35:01,188 --> 01:35:04,956
to be something of a genius
and found that wasn't the case at all

1722
01:35:06,050 --> 01:35:07,429
which is a good thing for me,

1723
01:35:07,549 --> 01:35:10,288
it's very good that I didn't count
that opinion, I don't think I was

1724
01:35:10,408 --> 01:35:13,253
so much clever,
I just think I was

1725
01:35:13,373 --> 01:35:16,048
quite enthusiastic particularly
when it came to O levels

1726
01:35:16,168 --> 01:35:20,121
so I was enthusiastic about the
subjects I was studying and therefore

1727
01:35:20,241 --> 01:35:23,758
with the help of good teaching
I was able to get good results

1728
01:35:23,878 --> 01:35:25,509
What were your results?

1729
01:35:26,148 --> 01:35:28,723
well, I did well enough, I'm
not going to boast

1730
01:35:28,843 --> 01:35:32,055
No, tell me. tell me the fact. How
many O levels and A levels did you get?

1731
01:35:32,175 --> 01:35:34,917
I got ten O levels and then

1732
01:35:35,037 --> 01:35:36,869
I got four A levels

1733
01:35:37,626 --> 01:35:39,543
Did you get good grades
within them?

1734
01:35:39,663 --> 01:35:41,613
yes, the grades were
quite satisfactory

1735
01:35:41,733 --> 01:35:42,743
well I was only

1736
01:35:42,863 --> 01:35:45,130
taking university seriously
for a matter of couple of months

1737
01:35:45,250 --> 01:35:46,688
two or three months

1738
01:35:48,270 --> 01:35:52,193
maybe I went to the wrong university
or maybe university life didn't suit me

1739
01:35:52,313 --> 01:35:53,304
either way

1740
01:35:54,028 --> 01:35:57,461
I felt a very great need
to get out of the system.

1741
01:35:57,581 --> 01:36:00,188
no formal education can
prepare anybody for life

1742
01:36:00,308 --> 01:36:03,453
only life can prepare
you for what comes

1743
01:36:03,806 --> 01:36:07,759
and sooner or later you are going
to have to cross certain barriers

1744
01:36:07,879 --> 01:36:10,351
I don't think you
ever cross those uh..

1745
01:36:10,805 --> 01:36:13,364
at school or at university

1746
01:36:14,138 --> 01:36:17,240
you come across the problem
of mixing with other people but

1747
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:19,714
the real problem.. I mean..

1748
01:36:19,834 --> 01:36:22,979
the real problem of becoming
a success in the world is

1749
01:36:23,099 --> 01:36:24,679
when you have to tackle yourself

1750
01:36:24,799 --> 01:36:29,132
on the grass.. we play
international wrestling

1751
01:36:29,252 --> 01:36:31,613
yeah, that's only
in summertime though

1752
01:36:31,733 --> 01:36:34,339
yes, only when we
can to go on the grass

1753
01:36:34,777 --> 01:36:38,648
being in set one, it's very very
hard to keep up with the leaders

1754
01:36:38,768 --> 01:36:41,004
I never have time to relax at all

1755
01:36:41,367 --> 01:36:45,625
I don't know what sort of stumbling
blocks should be put in a child's way

1756
01:36:45,745 --> 01:36:48,772
to get him used to
living in the outside world

1757
01:36:50,573 --> 01:36:53,922
because I think maybe this is something
that was wrong in my upbringing

1758
01:36:54,042 --> 01:36:56,363
I didn't have enough
obstacles to get over

1759
01:36:56,483 --> 01:36:57,524
I still..

1760
01:36:58,534 --> 01:37:02,977
I still.. set myself high standards
if I'm doing something that I want to do

1761
01:37:04,425 --> 01:37:05,392
but that's

1762
01:37:05,847 --> 01:37:08,539
that's important
that's not too bad a thing

1763
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:13,050
But you talked also about not
having enough obstacles in your life.

1764
01:37:13,170 --> 01:37:15,288
How do you feel about that now?

1765
01:37:17,813 --> 01:37:20,943
funny that isn't it? I can't remember
saying that but now I do remember

1766
01:37:21,063 --> 01:37:21,751
and

1767
01:37:22,441 --> 01:37:25,083
it seems the whole
situation is reversed

1768
01:37:29,123 --> 01:37:30,186
In what way?

1769
01:37:32,660 --> 01:37:34,259
well now I'm a free..

1770
01:37:35,168 --> 01:37:38,635
I've got a free hand but I've
got nothing to do with myself

1771
01:37:39,325 --> 01:37:40,065
so..

1772
01:37:41,092 --> 01:37:43,330
In the winter if
you lived in the country

1773
01:37:43,450 --> 01:37:47,605
it would just be all wet and there
wouldn't be anything for miles around

1774
01:37:47,891 --> 01:37:51,558
and you'd get soaked
if you'd try to go out

1775
01:37:51,678 --> 01:37:54,823
and there's no shelter
anywhere except in  your own house

1776
01:37:54,943 --> 01:37:58,290
but in winter you can go
out on wet wintery days

1777
01:37:58,410 --> 01:38:00,520
because you can always find
somewhere to shelter

1778
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:02,641
because there's lots of places

1779
01:38:03,457 --> 01:38:07,393
I don't thin I've been typical of the
environment in which I lived

1780
01:38:07,513 --> 01:38:09,228
I might still have been unemployed

1781
01:38:09,348 --> 01:38:11,735
but what my background has given me is

1782
01:38:12,173 --> 01:38:13,418
umm a sense..

1783
01:38:13,789 --> 01:38:15,903
of just being part of..

1784
01:38:17,788 --> 01:38:20,363
a very impersonal society

1785
01:38:20,483 --> 01:38:21,558
the suburbs..

1786
01:38:22,820 --> 01:38:23,998
the suburbs..

1787
01:38:24,605 --> 01:38:27,180
force this kind
of feeling upon somebody

1788
01:38:28,998 --> 01:38:31,303
the most you can hope to achieve is

1789
01:38:32,498 --> 01:38:35,441
is the right to climb
into a suburban train

1790
01:38:36,838 --> 01:38:39,767
five or ten times a week and
just stagger back

1791
01:38:40,541 --> 01:38:43,467
for the weekend,
the least is just unemployment

1792
01:38:45,336 --> 01:38:46,446
<i>great, thanks</i>

1793
01:38:47,019 --> 01:38:49,156
<i>I just needed a nice woolly pair</i>

1794
01:38:51,335 --> 01:38:54,482
What other things about
modern society turn you off?

1795
01:38:55,122 --> 01:38:57,764
the cheap satisfaction
in so many things

1796
01:38:58,471 --> 01:38:59,801
the aimlessness

1797
01:39:00,794 --> 01:39:04,338
but I think the total lack
of thought is at the bottom of it

1798
01:39:04,608 --> 01:39:07,519
nobody seems to know where
they or anybody else is going

1799
01:39:07,639 --> 01:39:09,438
and nobody seems to worry

1800
01:39:10,061 --> 01:39:12,079
you know, you finish the week

1801
01:39:12,199 --> 01:39:16,168
you come home, you plug into the TV
set for the weekend and then you..

1802
01:39:16,288 --> 01:39:18,171
manage to get back to work on Monday

1803
01:39:18,291 --> 01:39:21,318
and it seems to me that
this is just a slow path to..

1804
01:39:21,438 --> 01:39:23,893
to.. to total brainwashing

1805
01:39:24,163 --> 01:39:27,706
and if you have a brainwashed
society then you're heading towards doom

1806
01:39:27,826 --> 01:39:29,793
there's no question about that

1807
01:39:30,214 --> 01:39:32,314
I mean, it'll be pretty tough
to convince most people

1808
01:39:32,434 --> 01:39:35,293
that what you have here,
the way you live. the way you look

1809
01:39:35,413 --> 01:39:37,952
is better than a suburban life

1810
01:39:38,461 --> 01:39:41,423
well, I don't want to
convince anybody, I know it is

1811
01:39:41,543 --> 01:39:44,351
see, what I look like,
isn't necessarily what I feel like

1812
01:39:44,471 --> 01:39:48,273
I not claiming that I feel
as though I'm in some sort of..

1813
01:39:48,393 --> 01:39:49,467
Nirvana

1814
01:39:49,888 --> 01:39:50,544
but

1815
01:39:50,999 --> 01:39:54,954
but I'm claiming that if I lived in a
bedset in suburbia, I'd be so miserable

1816
01:39:55,074 --> 01:39:56,953
I'd feel like cutting my throat

1817
01:39:57,073 --> 01:39:59,124
and so, there is a slight difference

1818
01:39:59,494 --> 01:40:00,689
when I go home

1819
01:40:01,211 --> 01:40:04,813
I come.. I come in and
mummy gives me a cup of tea

1820
01:40:05,267 --> 01:40:07,094
and then I go out and play

1821
01:40:07,214 --> 01:40:10,931
and when it starts to get
dark I come in again

1822
01:40:11,200 --> 01:40:12,648
and put on TV

1823
01:40:12,768 --> 01:40:16,064
I don't think I was really taught
any sort of policy

1824
01:40:16,384 --> 01:40:19,902
of living at all `by my parents
this is probably the biggest mistake

1825
01:40:20,022 --> 01:40:23,016
that I was just left to fend
for myself in a world which

1826
01:40:23,136 --> 01:40:25,220
they seem completely oblivious of

1827
01:40:25,340 --> 01:40:29,933
and I found even when I tried to discuss
problems which were facing me in school

1828
01:40:30,539 --> 01:40:34,301
my parents didn't seem to be
aware of the nature of the problem

1829
01:40:35,799 --> 01:40:37,129
we.. we made up

1830
01:40:38,139 --> 01:40:39,940
quite.. quite well after..

1831
01:40:41,505 --> 01:40:45,071
the bad times we went through
when I was in my early twenties

1832
01:40:46,737 --> 01:40:49,396
there's still.. there are
still awkward patches

1833
01:40:49,516 --> 01:40:50,221
but

1834
01:40:51,163 --> 01:40:52,867
I think suddenly

1835
01:40:52,987 --> 01:40:56,856
perhaps almost mutually, it
dawned upon us that

1836
01:40:57,925 --> 01:40:59,808
we were all making mistakes

1837
01:41:00,094 --> 01:41:00,809
and

1838
01:41:01,213 --> 01:41:04,007
and also that some of
the things we did couldn't be helped

1839
01:41:04,127 --> 01:41:04,865
and

1840
01:41:05,623 --> 01:41:06,670
i think now

1841
01:41:07,006 --> 01:41:09,127
perhaps the greatest
thing we achieved is

1842
01:41:09,247 --> 01:41:11,045
we know when to say nothing

1843
01:41:11,165 --> 01:41:14,462
and we know when to do nothing and we
know when to be tolerant of each other

1844
01:41:14,582 --> 01:41:15,842
and that's a great thing

1845
01:41:15,962 --> 01:41:17,215
that's really tremendous

1846
01:41:17,686 --> 01:41:19,907
what I'd like most of all would be

1847
01:41:22,078 --> 01:41:23,677
would be to be able to

1848
01:41:23,797 --> 01:41:25,495
to do something for my parents

1849
01:41:25,615 --> 01:41:28,087
when they are older,
to be there when..

1850
01:41:30,022 --> 01:41:32,042
when the time..
if necessary

1851
01:41:35,181 --> 01:41:38,870
Were they upset with what you
said about them in the last program?

1852
01:41:38,990 --> 01:41:40,351
I'm sure they were

1853
01:41:41,108 --> 01:41:41,782
but I..

1854
01:41:42,657 --> 01:41:44,186
I don't wish I hadn't said it

1855
01:41:44,306 --> 01:41:46,408
because I said exactly what was going
through my mind

1856
01:41:46,528 --> 01:41:47,974
I think I was very venomous

1857
01:41:48,094 --> 01:41:49,288
and I think I

1858
01:41:50,012 --> 01:41:52,082
had I been in an easier situation myself

1859
01:41:52,202 --> 01:41:54,253
had I had less worries,
myself at the time

1860
01:41:54,373 --> 01:41:56,172
I would have been
perhaps a little kinder

1861
01:41:56,292 --> 01:42:00,650
I had to take out my anger on somebody
and I think it came out on my parents

1862
01:42:02,551 --> 01:42:06,936
but perhaps unconsciously a lot of what
I said was what I did feel underneath

1863
01:42:08,753 --> 01:42:09,410
but

1864
01:42:10,571 --> 01:42:12,860
but I don't want the scar to remain

1865
01:42:13,415 --> 01:42:16,865
when I get married, I don't
want to have any children

1866
01:42:16,985 --> 01:42:17,875
because

1867
01:42:18,767 --> 01:42:23,816
because they are always doing naughty
things and making the whole house untidy

1868
01:42:24,565 --> 01:42:26,702
I always told myself that umm..

1869
01:42:27,510 --> 01:42:29,395
I would never have children

1870
01:42:31,179 --> 01:42:31,869
Why?

1871
01:42:32,610 --> 01:42:33,502
because..

1872
01:42:34,091 --> 01:42:35,047
because..

1873
01:42:35,468 --> 01:42:36,781
well, because..

1874
01:42:37,184 --> 01:42:39,726
children inherit something
from their parents

1875
01:42:39,846 --> 01:42:42,166
and even if my wife were the most

1876
01:42:42,890 --> 01:42:45,768
high spirited and ordinary
and normal of people

1877
01:42:46,727 --> 01:42:50,766
the child would still stand a fairly
good chance of being not totally

1878
01:42:52,565 --> 01:42:53,844
full of happiness

1879
01:42:53,964 --> 01:42:57,648
because of what he or she
will have inherited from me

1880
01:42:58,254 --> 01:43:00,980
poor people, I don't like them very much

1881
01:43:01,586 --> 01:43:05,232
no, it's the ghostly colored people

1882
01:43:05,737 --> 01:43:10,668
if you think of a purple person
with red eyes and yellow feet

1883
01:43:12,033 --> 01:43:15,147
I can't really think of
what they really look like

1884
01:43:16,207 --> 01:43:19,741
What goes through your mind when you
look at those two films?

1885
01:43:19,861 --> 01:43:22,653
When you are seven, bright and perky?

1886
01:43:24,471 --> 01:43:28,424
I find it hard to believe that I was
ever like that but there's the evidence

1887
01:43:28,544 --> 01:43:31,571
I wonder why I was like that
I wonder what it was

1888
01:43:31,841 --> 01:43:33,911
inside me that made me like that

1889
01:43:35,565 --> 01:43:38,864
and I can even see at fourteen that
I was beginning to get more subdued

1890
01:43:38,984 --> 01:43:41,624
and I was putting a lot more thought
into what I was saying

1891
01:43:41,744 --> 01:43:43,391
to a ridiculous degree

1892
01:43:46,113 --> 01:43:48,284
and probably when I was seven..

1893
01:43:50,017 --> 01:43:53,474
I lived in a wonderful world
where everything was sensation

1894
01:43:53,794 --> 01:43:55,939
and I could be happy obviously
but be miserable the next minute

1895
01:43:56,059 --> 01:44:00,692
I know at seven years old I was
fascinated by everything around me

1896
01:44:01,820 --> 01:44:04,763
the colors of things and
things that were funny

1897
01:44:05,150 --> 01:44:06,850
sounds that things made

1898
01:44:08,180 --> 01:44:12,005
I had, if you like, idiosyncratic views

1899
01:44:12,125 --> 01:44:15,505
about things that other
people hadn't even thought about

1900
01:44:16,330 --> 01:44:20,148
I remember I thought colored people
had purple noses and green legs

1901
01:44:20,268 --> 01:44:21,730
or something like that

1902
01:44:24,003 --> 01:44:26,140
perhaps I'm still looking for..

1903
01:44:27,724 --> 01:44:30,905
it's difficult to explain,
perhaps I'm still looking for..

1904
01:44:31,025 --> 01:44:33,715
the green nose and this sort of thing

1905
01:44:33,835 --> 01:44:35,247
and I know that..

1906
01:44:36,054 --> 01:44:38,899
that they are still there
that when you look at a human being

1907
01:44:39,019 --> 01:44:41,979
there's more.. there's
more to that person then..

1908
01:44:43,090 --> 01:44:44,718
just a.. just a robot

1909
01:44:46,284 --> 01:44:48,606
when I grow up I want to be an astronaut

1910
01:44:48,726 --> 01:44:52,629
but if I can't be an astronaut
I think I'll be a coach driver

1911
01:44:53,251 --> 01:44:55,942
this probably linked up now with
the fact that I want to travel

1912
01:44:56,062 --> 01:44:57,726
my thoughts haven't really changed

1913
01:44:57,846 --> 01:45:00,873
I definitely would like
to be a coach driver now

1914
01:45:02,421 --> 01:45:03,625
I suppose I..

1915
01:45:04,298 --> 01:45:05,358
yes, well..

1916
01:45:05,478 --> 01:45:08,202
I would like to be somebody
in a position of importance

1917
01:45:08,322 --> 01:45:10,273
and I've always thought this..

1918
01:45:10,761 --> 01:45:13,822
but I don't think I'm the right sort of
person to carry the responsibility

1919
01:45:13,942 --> 01:45:16,060
for whatever it is I always
thought, well, I'd love to be in

1920
01:45:18,232 --> 01:45:20,655
possibly even love to be in politics

1921
01:45:21,546 --> 01:45:22,691
something like this

1922
01:45:22,811 --> 01:45:23,549
but

1923
01:45:24,542 --> 01:45:29,591
I suppose I'd find it just as tedious
as all of the other jobs I've done so..

1924
01:45:31,274 --> 01:45:34,113
there were things I
always thought I could do

1925
01:45:35,341 --> 01:45:37,142
I could give lectures on..

1926
01:45:38,085 --> 01:45:40,391
erudite subjects I'd read all about

1927
01:45:41,671 --> 01:45:43,573
I could work in the theatre

1928
01:45:44,616 --> 01:45:46,400
perhaps lighting or

1929
01:45:47,873 --> 01:45:49,219
directing a show

1930
01:45:53,010 --> 01:45:54,912
And is all of that lost to you?

1931
01:45:55,032 --> 01:45:56,645
does seem to be, yes

1932
01:46:01,408 --> 01:46:03,932
I don't see anyway out, I've thought
of everything I possibly could

1933
01:46:04,052 --> 01:46:07,685
it seemed to me for a long time that
getting a reliable job

1934
01:46:07,805 --> 01:46:09,654
and a nice place to live
would be the solution

1935
01:46:09,774 --> 01:46:11,236
well, I haven't succeeded

1936
01:46:12,346 --> 01:46:14,803
I can't see any immediate future at all

1937
01:46:15,392 --> 01:46:16,049
but

1938
01:46:16,169 --> 01:46:17,647
here I am, I'm still

1939
01:46:17,967 --> 01:46:19,650
I've still got clothes on my back

1940
01:46:19,770 --> 01:46:22,427
not particularly nice clothes
but I've still got them

1941
01:46:22,547 --> 01:46:24,236
I have a place to go to

1942
01:46:25,583 --> 01:46:30,076
I have some prospects of work, I'm still
applying for jobs, I haven't given up

1943
01:46:30,817 --> 01:46:33,777
I think, I think I'm lucky
because I have met so many people

1944
01:46:33,897 --> 01:46:37,109
I've worked with people who have
no future whatsoever

1945
01:46:37,682 --> 01:46:39,634
for whom life is finished
completely at fifty

1946
01:46:39,754 --> 01:46:42,226
and yet somehow they have to keep going

1947
01:46:43,051 --> 01:46:43,791
and

1948
01:46:45,962 --> 01:46:50,083
I don't want it to seem
that I'm complaining too much

1949
01:46:53,483 --> 01:46:58,193
I feel, especially sometimes when I'm on
my own

1950
01:46:58,313 --> 01:47:01,156
that I'm loosing touch
with where people live

1951
01:47:03,428 --> 01:47:05,493
Do you worry about your sanity?

1952
01:47:09,599 --> 01:47:11,956
other people sometimes worry about it

1953
01:47:12,831 --> 01:47:13,790
Like who?

1954
01:47:18,626 --> 01:47:19,586
as I've said, I

1955
01:47:19,939 --> 01:47:22,074
sometimes can be found

1956
01:47:22,194 --> 01:47:24,851
behaving in an erratic fashion

1957
01:47:26,063 --> 01:47:28,924
sometimes I can get very
frustrated, very angry

1958
01:47:29,044 --> 01:47:31,701
for no apparent reason, for a
reason which won't be apparent

1959
01:47:31,821 --> 01:47:33,569
to other people around me

1960
01:47:36,043 --> 01:47:38,164
it's happened from time to time

1961
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:42,547
Have you had treatment?

1962
01:47:43,573 --> 01:47:46,165
I've occasionally
had to see doctors, yes

1963
01:47:47,713 --> 01:47:49,598
I haven't had any treatment

1964
01:47:51,535 --> 01:47:53,605
And what have they said to you?

1965
01:47:54,548 --> 01:47:58,284
I've had a lot of advice
but you know the best medicine is..

1966
01:48:00,203 --> 01:48:01,240
kind words

1967
01:48:03,057 --> 01:48:04,151
and it usually comes

1968
01:48:04,271 --> 01:48:07,282
from somebody who has nothing to do
with the medical profession

1969
01:48:07,402 --> 01:48:11,052
which isn't to say that doctor's
can't be very helpful

1970
01:48:13,341 --> 01:48:15,546
but really, the thing
a sick person wants

1971
01:48:15,666 --> 01:48:18,508
is to be away from
doctors as soon as possible

1972
01:48:20,527 --> 01:48:22,730
What did they say was wrong with you?

1973
01:48:22,850 --> 01:48:25,507
well, I have always had a nervous
complain

1974
01:48:25,627 --> 01:48:27,711
I've had it since I was sixteen

1975
01:48:27,831 --> 01:48:29,882
it was responsible
for my leaving university

1976
01:48:30,002 --> 01:48:32,440
and some of my difficulties with work

1977
01:48:33,433 --> 01:48:36,109
but as you know, you can't avoid to
go around looking depressed

1978
01:48:36,229 --> 01:48:38,079
that in itself is bad enough

1979
01:48:38,471 --> 01:48:39,985
So can you lick it?

1980
01:48:42,746 --> 01:48:44,378
it remains to be seen

1981
01:48:45,809 --> 01:48:47,490
yes, I'd say I believed in god

1982
01:48:47,610 --> 01:48:48,971
Are you religious?

1983
01:48:50,267 --> 01:48:52,724
well, I go to church
with my parents on Sundays

1984
01:48:52,844 --> 01:48:55,989
I don't know now whether
I believe in god or not

1985
01:48:56,494 --> 01:49:00,146
I thought an awful lot about it actually
and I still don't know

1986
01:49:00,971 --> 01:49:04,604
but still I'm certain, if one were
to survive in this world

1987
01:49:04,724 --> 01:49:06,085
they'd have to believe in god

1988
01:49:06,205 --> 01:49:09,384
I don't think of god as a
creature but I think of..

1989
01:49:10,343 --> 01:49:11,400
something..

1990
01:49:12,006 --> 01:49:13,352
time.. destiny..

1991
01:49:14,194 --> 01:49:17,795
which is regulating everybody's affairs
and witch you cannot

1992
01:49:18,351 --> 01:49:20,774
you cannot fight against
and you cannot..

1993
01:49:20,894 --> 01:49:21,945
order about

1994
01:49:24,082 --> 01:49:26,287
And how has he been treating you?

1995
01:49:27,310 --> 01:49:29,478
well I said to somebody lasy week

1996
01:49:29,598 --> 01:49:32,585
that I preferred The Old Testament
to The New Testament

1997
01:49:32,705 --> 01:49:34,908
because in The Old Testament

1998
01:49:35,028 --> 01:49:36,827
god is very unpredictable

1999
01:49:38,055 --> 01:49:42,482
and that's, I think,
how I see him in my life

2000
01:49:42,602 --> 01:49:44,602
sometimes very benevolent

2001
01:49:45,276 --> 01:49:48,305
sometimes, seemingly, needlessly unkind

2002
01:49:49,197 --> 01:49:53,035
If we come back in seven years, how
would you like us to find you?

2003
01:49:55,374 --> 01:49:58,496
In a job, for which
I was getting satisfaction

2004
01:49:59,691 --> 01:50:00,583
married

2005
01:50:02,081 --> 01:50:03,663
probably with children

2006
01:50:04,067 --> 01:50:04,772
with

2007
01:50:05,613 --> 01:50:06,775
a good salary

2008
01:50:09,568 --> 01:50:13,490
enough to, as I said before,
live fairly comfortably

2009
01:50:15,469 --> 01:50:18,768
and with fiends whom
I could contact if I wanted to

2010
01:50:28,652 --> 01:50:31,564
I'm a lot happier now,
than I was seven years ago

2011
01:50:31,684 --> 01:50:34,964
I'm more content, I don't
have such dreadful yearnings

2012
01:50:35,806 --> 01:50:39,254
I don't feel so hopelessly
as if everything is against me

2013
01:50:40,752 --> 01:50:42,671
Do you think, what a waste?

2014
01:50:42,791 --> 01:50:44,034
yeah, perhaps

2015
01:50:45,650 --> 01:50:47,518
Why should you accept this?

2016
01:50:47,638 --> 01:50:49,639
You're better than
all of this aren't you?

2017
01:50:49,759 --> 01:50:53,072
I'm not better than anything or anybody

2018
01:50:53,192 --> 01:50:58,293
I'm just somebody with
my own particular difficulties

2019
01:50:58,413 --> 01:51:01,046
and my own
particular obstacles to select

2020
01:51:01,635 --> 01:51:04,917
and everybody else is doing
exactly the same thing

2021
01:51:09,737 --> 01:51:13,086
if we did all love Jeffery
and all wanted to marry him

2022
01:51:13,206 --> 01:51:15,728
-yes!
-I think I'd know the one he'd like

2023
01:51:15,848 --> 01:51:17,697
Jackie, Lynn, Susan

2024
01:51:18,707 --> 01:51:20,895
After primary school they separated

2025
01:51:21,015 --> 01:51:23,150
and at fourteen Lynn
was at grammar school

2026
01:51:23,270 --> 01:51:25,658
and Jackie and Susan
were at comprehensive.

2027
01:51:25,778 --> 01:51:27,609
we had a teacher at school

2028
01:51:28,299 --> 01:51:31,488
his favorite ploy was

2029
01:51:31,608 --> 01:51:35,402
all you girls want to do is walk out,
get married, have babies

2030
01:51:35,522 --> 01:51:39,492
and push a pram down the street with a
fag hanging outside your mouth

2031
01:51:40,222 --> 01:51:44,172
women are expanding into so
many different areas now that

2032
01:51:44,292 --> 01:51:46,419
it must be getting easier

2033
01:51:46,539 --> 01:51:49,805
Susan has been married four years
and has a son of two.

2034
01:51:50,108 --> 01:51:52,009
Her husband Billy is a gas fitter

2035
01:51:52,129 --> 01:51:55,712
and they live in a council
house in the east end of London.

2036
01:51:56,476 --> 01:51:57,150
<i>75!</i>

2037
01:51:59,927 --> 01:52:03,023
I'm lucky I expect
because I still manage to..

2038
01:52:03,526 --> 01:52:07,010
to do my own thing, I've got a husband
who lets me do what I want

2039
01:52:07,130 --> 01:52:09,131
and a mum who helps me out

2040
01:52:09,251 --> 01:52:10,999
you know, and I do
a little part time job

2041
01:52:11,119 --> 01:52:15,106
which is enough for me because I don't
think I could cope with a full time job

2042
01:52:15,226 --> 01:52:16,671
and I wouldn't want to personally

2043
01:52:16,791 --> 01:52:17,698
<i>60!</i>

2044
01:52:18,354 --> 01:52:21,767
Jackie was married at 19
and her husband is a decorator

2045
01:52:22,255 --> 01:52:24,998
She works for an
insurance company in the city

2046
01:52:25,118 --> 01:52:28,953
I certainly don't want to stay in the
position I am at the moment

2047
01:52:29,441 --> 01:52:30,798
forever and ever

2048
01:52:31,454 --> 01:52:33,457
but how ambitious, I'm not really sure

2049
01:52:33,577 --> 01:52:34,618
tends to..

2050
01:52:35,275 --> 01:52:37,193
change as you get older so..

2051
01:52:37,614 --> 01:52:39,735
just got to wait and see really

2052
01:52:40,357 --> 01:52:42,098
Lynn also married at 19,

2053
01:52:42,889 --> 01:52:46,390
her husband works at the post office
and they have two daughters.

2054
01:52:46,510 --> 01:52:49,705
They moved out of the Eastend to Kent
18 months ago.

2055
01:52:50,311 --> 01:52:52,407
I'm going to work in Woolworth's

2056
01:52:53,266 --> 01:52:56,949
At 21 Lynn was working in a mobile
library in Tower Hamlets

2057
01:52:57,069 --> 01:52:58,111
she's still there.

2058
01:52:58,231 --> 01:52:59,915
<i>- have I stamped yours?
- yes</i>

2059
01:53:00,302 --> 01:53:01,934
<i>I've not stamped yours</i>

2060
01:53:02,054 --> 01:53:03,348
<i>Sleeping Beauty</i>

2061
01:53:03,903 --> 01:53:07,303
teaching children the beauty of books

2062
01:53:07,791 --> 01:53:09,474
and watching their faces

2063
01:53:09,895 --> 01:53:11,612
as books unfold to them

2064
01:53:12,150 --> 01:53:13,526
is just fantastic

2065
01:53:13,829 --> 01:53:18,188
to work with children of that age you've
got to love them and I love children

2066
01:53:18,458 --> 01:53:22,076
but I know he loves her
and he loves her

2067
01:53:22,196 --> 01:53:23,811
- I don't, I love him!

2068
01:53:24,905 --> 01:53:26,402
I don't think I'd..

2069
01:53:28,220 --> 01:53:29,802
get married too early

2070
01:53:29,922 --> 01:53:31,923
I'd like to have a full
life first and

2071
01:53:32,043 --> 01:53:34,714
- you'd like to enjoy yourself before?
- meet people.. yeah

2072
01:53:34,834 --> 01:53:37,207
before you commit yourself
to a family

2073
01:53:37,327 --> 01:53:38,621
if you think that

2074
01:53:38,741 --> 01:53:40,885
getting married, as far as we
are concerned is a case of

2075
01:53:41,005 --> 01:53:44,938
going to work come home cook tea for
hubby go to bed getting up going to work

2076
01:53:45,058 --> 01:53:46,722
you're totally mistaken

2077
01:53:46,842 --> 01:53:49,920
Did you meet enough men before you
decided who you wanted to marry?

2078
01:53:50,040 --> 01:53:52,007
I've been married a year and..

2079
01:53:52,646 --> 01:53:54,043
a couple of months

2080
01:53:55,053 --> 01:53:57,537
you do think, christ, what
have I done?

2081
01:53:59,574 --> 01:54:03,024
- see I've still got my...
- and I'm being honest about it!

2082
01:54:03,411 --> 01:54:07,415
I think it's the same... you
think, christ, what have I done?

2083
01:54:08,088 --> 01:54:10,292
it is a partnership marriage, yes

2084
01:54:12,043 --> 01:54:14,599
we were married,
i'd say obviously, young

2085
01:54:15,845 --> 01:54:19,059
but because we wanted to go out and
have fun together

2086
01:54:19,783 --> 01:54:21,298
and grow together

2087
01:54:21,836 --> 01:54:24,009
I'm not sure I would recommend it

2088
01:54:24,329 --> 01:54:26,265
I think if...

2089
01:54:26,837 --> 01:54:29,042
but again you are
generalizing, I mean if..

2090
01:54:29,162 --> 01:54:31,138
I would say on average

2091
01:54:31,879 --> 01:54:33,579
19 is probably too young

2092
01:54:34,269 --> 01:54:36,640
I've had a good time
up till I was 24

2093
01:54:37,263 --> 01:54:37,986
and

2094
01:54:38,357 --> 01:54:39,989
and I think that to get married young

2095
01:54:40,109 --> 01:54:44,483
there must be things that you miss,
you must miss that crucial stage

2096
01:54:44,839 --> 01:54:46,168
of being yourself

2097
01:54:46,288 --> 01:54:48,743
because the minute you
get married, you're no longer

2098
01:54:48,863 --> 01:54:50,056
a single being

2099
01:54:50,176 --> 01:54:53,658
you're a partnership and that
should be the idea behind it

2100
01:54:53,944 --> 01:54:58,775
if I could, I would have two girls
and two boys - yeah, so would I

2101
01:54:59,061 --> 01:55:00,711
And what about you Jackie?

2102
01:55:00,831 --> 01:55:06,400
my mum... because she's got five
girls, she's got seven years bad luck

2103
01:55:06,520 --> 01:55:08,537
that's why she's got five girls

2104
01:55:08,657 --> 01:55:10,226
I'd like to be able..

2105
01:55:10,664 --> 01:55:12,279
to have a happy family

2106
01:55:12,784 --> 01:55:15,948
I mean I know that it's
not possible to happy all of the time

2107
01:55:16,068 --> 01:55:18,591
but as much of the time as was possible

2108
01:55:19,264 --> 01:55:21,560
go through there, that's the nursery

2109
01:55:22,098 --> 01:55:24,337
-got any plans
-oh, do me a favor

2110
01:55:24,690 --> 01:55:27,383
at 21 Jackie had moved into
a new house

2111
01:55:28,275 --> 01:55:30,781
she has decided not to have any children

2112
01:55:31,252 --> 01:55:34,315
basically, I would say because
I am far too selfish

2113
01:55:34,618 --> 01:55:35,558
I enjoy

2114
01:55:36,215 --> 01:55:39,328
doing what I want, when I
want and how I want and..

2115
01:55:40,136 --> 01:55:42,072
certainly at the moment I..

2116
01:55:43,132 --> 01:55:45,133
can't see any way around that

2117
01:55:46,277 --> 01:55:49,576
that's not to say
that's a forever decision

2118
01:55:49,696 --> 01:55:53,110
some people can make it work, I
just don't think I could

2119
01:55:53,788 --> 01:55:56,110
You don't think you're missing
out on what they have?

2120
01:55:56,230 --> 01:55:58,029
Their stake in the future?

2121
01:55:58,786 --> 01:55:59,527
no..

2122
01:56:00,015 --> 01:56:03,510
that's a very... that's a terrible
way to put it, you know

2123
01:56:03,981 --> 01:56:06,051
I mean, that makes you
sound like you're saying

2124
01:56:06,171 --> 01:56:07,953
"right, great, we're
going to have a child"

2125
01:56:08,073 --> 01:56:09,602
and that.. that's us

2126
01:56:09,973 --> 01:56:12,851
I do feel to a degree that
yes I am missing out

2127
01:56:13,137 --> 01:56:15,207
but I think I also get far more

2128
01:56:16,570 --> 01:56:17,900
pleasure out of

2129
01:56:19,143 --> 01:56:22,021
I'm gaining far more experience
by not having that tie

2130
01:56:22,141 --> 01:56:23,300
when I got married

2131
01:56:23,420 --> 01:56:25,437
the primary reason was because I

2132
01:56:25,557 --> 01:56:28,870
wanted to have a child
the two, to me, went together

2133
01:56:30,638 --> 01:56:33,093
I can understand Jackie's decision
because

2134
01:56:33,213 --> 01:56:36,393
I think there is sill
a lot of pressure put on

2135
01:56:36,513 --> 01:56:39,540
young married couples to have children
as though it was expected of them

2136
01:56:39,660 --> 01:56:42,275
and I think it's all wrong, it's just a
personal decision

2137
01:56:42,395 --> 01:56:43,881
that everyone is entitled to make

2138
01:56:44,001 --> 01:56:45,901
and knowing what it
does to your life I can

2139
01:56:46,021 --> 01:56:48,543
fully understand someone
who decides not to

2140
01:56:48,663 --> 01:56:52,803
what would you do if
you had lots of money about.. 

2141
01:56:52,923 --> 01:56:56,506
I would by me self
a new house, you know

2142
01:56:57,112 --> 01:56:59,500
one that's all nice and comfy

2143
01:57:00,072 --> 01:57:02,613
Do you get depressed by money problems?

2144
01:57:03,388 --> 01:57:04,280
no, why?

2145
01:57:04,633 --> 01:57:05,963
why should you?

2146
01:57:06,484 --> 01:57:09,059
if can manage with what you got?
-it's easy to get depressed over money

2147
01:57:09,179 --> 01:57:11,516
-it's so easy to but why should you?

2148
01:57:11,636 --> 01:57:14,039
- why bother about it
- when I reach the 18th day of the month

2149
01:57:14,159 --> 01:57:15,671
when my mortgage is due on the 20th

2150
01:57:15,791 --> 01:57:17,650
and there's nowhere near
enough money in there

2151
01:57:17,770 --> 01:57:19,778
 I get depressed about it obviously

2152
01:57:20,687 --> 01:57:21,829
what money?

2153
01:57:22,581 --> 01:57:27,207
it was hard, first of all, when I gave
up work from having a fairly high salary

2154
01:57:28,974 --> 01:57:30,439
to nothing was hard

2155
01:57:31,196 --> 01:57:34,526
but you get used to it
whatever your circumstances are

2156
01:57:35,536 --> 01:57:39,306
you live in them, you get used to it,
you cope, everybody does

2157
01:57:39,426 --> 01:57:42,420
I think before going to a
grammar school, I just

2158
01:57:43,110 --> 01:57:44,826
you know, comprehensive school

2159
01:57:44,946 --> 01:57:48,327
it just seem more friendly, you know,
and at the time it was but now

2160
01:57:48,447 --> 01:57:50,045
now they are really different

2161
01:57:50,165 --> 01:57:52,939
-grammar schools are fantastic
-if you say so

2162
01:57:53,865 --> 01:57:56,546
<i>we've heard that it doesn't
scratch the bottom, why am I using </i>

2163
01:57:56,666 --> 01:57:59,434
<i>wooden spoon please?
to stir this saucepan..</i>

2164
01:58:00,090 --> 01:58:03,925
I don't think anybody influenced
me, it was a conscious decision

2165
01:58:04,716 --> 01:58:06,366
obviously, the decision

2166
01:58:06,635 --> 01:58:08,267
was discussed at home

2167
01:58:08,387 --> 01:58:09,075
but

2168
01:58:10,371 --> 01:58:11,897
it was always in me

2169
01:58:13,630 --> 01:58:14,539
to go

2170
01:58:14,659 --> 01:58:17,602
there may come a time, perhaps
later on when I regret

2171
01:58:18,090 --> 01:58:18,982
not having..

2172
01:58:19,102 --> 01:58:23,526
we are talking about examination results
really, that's what it boils down to

2173
01:58:24,284 --> 01:58:25,580
and.. I got..

2174
01:58:26,320 --> 01:58:30,105
and I got some examination results and
O levels and GCSEs or whatever

2175
01:58:30,225 --> 01:58:31,384
I didn't need them

2176
01:58:31,504 --> 01:58:33,858
for the jobs I decided to do, so

2177
01:58:33,978 --> 01:58:36,972
with this school, we do
metal work and woodwork

2178
01:58:37,092 --> 01:58:38,587
and the boys do cookery

2179
01:58:38,707 --> 01:58:41,566
and we get a share
of everything.. sort of thing

2180
01:58:41,686 --> 01:58:43,434
most parents would want

2181
01:58:43,771 --> 01:58:46,295
every advantage they can
get for their child, now

2182
01:58:46,415 --> 01:58:49,022
whether you class going to
grammar school as an advantage

2183
01:58:49,142 --> 01:58:51,462
is dependent on you entire outlook

2184
01:58:52,177 --> 01:58:53,271
if you don't

2185
01:58:53,709 --> 01:58:56,200
class it as an advantage then you
are not going to push that

2186
01:58:56,320 --> 01:58:59,330
my mum left me, she knew
I could go to grammar

2187
01:58:59,667 --> 01:59:00,390
and

2188
01:59:01,080 --> 01:59:03,030
and I decided that I didn't want to

2189
01:59:03,150 --> 01:59:06,413
she encouraged me in
the choice that I made and

2190
01:59:06,533 --> 01:59:08,592
right or wrong that was my choice

2191
01:59:08,712 --> 01:59:10,705
as much as I was capable
of making a decision

2192
01:59:10,825 --> 01:59:11,524
and

2193
01:59:11,793 --> 01:59:12,887
I enjoyed myself

2194
01:59:13,007 --> 01:59:17,986
my father recently go education, he
never went to the local comprehensive

2195
01:59:18,458 --> 01:59:19,989
but at the same time

2196
01:59:21,723 --> 01:59:25,722
I don't think he was too worried
which way I was decided to go

2197
01:59:26,783 --> 01:59:29,257
I think he probably knew
me better than I did

2198
01:59:29,377 --> 01:59:33,414
which was basically, I was a
very lazy person academically

2199
01:59:33,534 --> 01:59:36,907
and I think I would have
found grammar school bullshit

2200
01:59:37,027 --> 01:59:39,247
Do you have any regrets about it?

2201
01:59:39,367 --> 01:59:41,457
umm.. no, no

2202
01:59:41,743 --> 01:59:44,840
you can only have regrets about things
if you're not happy with the way you are

2203
01:59:46,893 --> 01:59:50,274
You look at the old film and you see
yourselves as seven,

2204
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:52,310
do you think you've changed?

2205
01:59:52,430 --> 01:59:54,599
no, I don't think I have really

2206
01:59:54,719 --> 01:59:56,939
we're the same people as we were then

2207
01:59:57,059 --> 01:59:59,607
I was always chatty,
Jackie was always chatty

2208
01:59:59,727 --> 02:00:02,002
 and Lynn was always the quieter one

2209
02:00:02,122 --> 02:00:04,057
But is that depressing
or frightening to think

2210
02:00:04,177 --> 02:00:06,801
we're all set by the time
we're seven and that's it?

2211
02:00:06,921 --> 02:00:09,974
I don't think one's set
by that age, you progress

2212
02:00:10,094 --> 02:00:10,748
but

2213
02:00:10,868 --> 02:00:13,481
the overall character
is there to come up

2214
02:00:14,828 --> 02:00:16,477
I think the basics are there

2215
02:00:16,597 --> 02:00:18,547
yeah, the basics are there

2216
02:00:18,667 --> 02:00:21,644
But why is it that you three
haven't changed so much do you think?

2217
02:00:21,764 --> 02:00:25,279
- we'll probably never no that
- I think we've all had

2218
02:00:25,700 --> 02:00:30,751
we've all had a stable background with
stable relationships all the way through

2219
02:00:32,367 --> 02:00:34,757
the same people are there now
that were there then

2220
02:00:34,877 --> 02:00:37,871
the poor, if you don't help then
soon they'll sort of

2221
02:00:37,991 --> 02:00:39,368
die soon, wouldn't they?

2222
02:00:39,488 --> 02:00:42,987
well, some people are just born
into rich families and they're lucky

2223
02:00:43,107 --> 02:00:46,276
I don't see why they should have to luck
when people have worked all their lives

2224
02:00:46,396 --> 02:00:48,827
and haven't got half
as much as what they have

2225
02:00:48,947 --> 02:00:50,695
it just doesn't seem fair

2226
02:00:50,815 --> 02:00:53,422
I've had the opportunities
in life that I've wanted

2227
02:00:53,542 --> 02:00:56,973
- I'll say I've had more!
- yeah, you..

2228
02:00:57,242 --> 02:01:00,101
So you three working class
girls don't feel

2229
02:01:00,421 --> 02:01:02,390
bitter about a society

2230
02:01:03,046 --> 02:01:07,052
that maybe gives one strata of it
more opportunities than another?

2231
02:01:09,560 --> 02:01:10,200
no

2232
02:01:11,344 --> 02:01:12,395
not bitter

2233
02:01:12,515 --> 02:01:13,775
not at all

2234
02:01:14,189 --> 02:01:17,722
I don't event think, to be honest,
we consciously think about it

2235
02:01:17,842 --> 02:01:20,886
until this program comes
up once every seven years

2236
02:01:21,006 --> 02:01:23,545
I really don't think
we even think about it

2237
02:01:23,665 --> 02:01:25,885
I don't not sit there thinking

2238
02:01:26,794 --> 02:01:28,948
"he actually was born into money!"

2239
02:01:29,068 --> 02:01:30,261
"he's had more opportun.."

2240
02:01:30,381 --> 02:01:32,932
I mean it just doesn't
even cross my mind

2241
02:01:33,992 --> 02:01:38,116
I think we all could have gone in
whatever way we wanted to at the time

2242
02:01:38,236 --> 02:01:40,404
within our capabilities, I mean

2243
02:01:41,162 --> 02:01:43,501
we chose our own jobs

2244
02:01:44,511 --> 02:01:47,322
we were able to chose our
own jobs quite freely

2245
02:01:47,442 --> 02:01:51,916
if you've got a comfortable background
then perhaps it can make life easy

2246
02:01:52,036 --> 02:01:54,254
but I think you've also seen

2247
02:01:54,910 --> 02:01:57,687
within this program that it
doesn't always work that way

2248
02:01:57,807 --> 02:01:59,135
In some respects

2249
02:01:59,741 --> 02:02:00,969
I think that..

2250
02:02:02,417 --> 02:02:03,838
the boys and Suzi

2251
02:02:05,118 --> 02:02:06,161
didn't have

2252
02:02:07,053 --> 02:02:08,854
didn't have such an
open choice as we had

2253
02:02:08,974 --> 02:02:12,371
it was mapped out for such an early
age as to where they were going

2254
02:02:12,491 --> 02:02:13,230
and

2255
02:02:13,499 --> 02:02:15,171
and they had to live up

2256
02:02:15,929 --> 02:02:18,538
it's a hard thing
living up to parental..

2257
02:02:20,540 --> 02:02:22,560
- expectations
- expectations

2258
02:02:27,708 --> 02:02:31,055
before I'm old and that,
enough to get a job

2259
02:02:31,829 --> 02:02:33,428
I'll just walk around

2260
02:02:34,404 --> 02:02:35,835
and see what I can find

2261
02:02:35,955 --> 02:02:38,275
I was going to be a film star but..

2262
02:02:39,824 --> 02:02:42,870
now I'm going to be
an electrical engineer

2263
02:02:42,990 --> 02:02:44,520
which is more to reality, really

2264
02:02:44,640 --> 02:02:47,707
I often say I'm saving to
settle down with Yvonne

2265
02:02:48,730 --> 02:02:52,298
and then I think to myself "nah
I might buy a car instead"

2266
02:02:52,418 --> 02:02:53,829
since 21

2267
02:02:56,238 --> 02:02:57,517
I've got married

2268
02:02:57,921 --> 02:02:59,469
had a couple of kids

2269
02:03:00,143 --> 02:03:01,068
and um..

2270
02:03:03,425 --> 02:03:07,227
well, I don't think there's anybody else
I could have ever married except Yvonne

2271
02:03:07,347 --> 02:03:09,482
it gives me my life really because

2272
02:03:09,602 --> 02:03:12,444
we're together, we have the
children and everything

2273
02:03:12,564 --> 02:03:15,306
And what is it with Yvonne
that you fell in love with?

2274
02:03:15,426 --> 02:03:16,804
her nature, really

2275
02:03:17,326 --> 02:03:19,228
it's always quite thoughtful

2276
02:03:20,120 --> 02:03:22,005
except when she's laughing

2277
02:03:22,125 --> 02:03:24,462
Tell me, do you have any girlfriends?

2278
02:03:24,582 --> 02:03:25,823
well, not many

2279
02:03:26,261 --> 02:03:27,994
What do you thing about girls?

2280
02:03:28,114 --> 02:03:29,206
oh, not much

2281
02:03:31,714 --> 02:03:36,106
When you decided to have the five, did
you want to have them close together?

2282
02:03:36,226 --> 02:03:36,962
yeah

2283
02:03:37,265 --> 02:03:42,196
because if you separated your kids
and say one is fifteen and one is six

2284
02:03:42,735 --> 02:03:45,579
such an age gap that
they could never get on

2285
02:03:46,336 --> 02:03:49,649
they'd never grow up together,
they won't know each other

2286
02:03:49,769 --> 02:03:52,342
Why did you want to have
a large family?

2287
02:03:52,931 --> 02:03:55,691
well I wouldn't really
call it a large family

2288
02:03:56,400 --> 02:03:59,312
Well, I think it is large
by average standards.

2289
02:03:59,432 --> 02:04:00,204
yeah?

2290
02:04:01,298 --> 02:04:03,015
we just wanted five kids

2291
02:04:03,135 --> 02:04:06,212
you know, we got exactly what we want,
three boys and two girls

2292
02:04:08,923 --> 02:04:12,794
no, no... that's exactly...
it's a handful, you know

2293
02:04:13,097 --> 02:04:15,285
Do you push your
kids at school?

2294
02:04:15,655 --> 02:04:17,473
Those that go to
school already?

2295
02:04:17,593 --> 02:04:20,164
no, I don't push them,
I encourage them in what..

2296
02:04:20,284 --> 02:04:23,361
when they come home
and I come home in the evening

2297
02:04:23,681 --> 02:04:25,633
they tell me what they've done

2298
02:04:25,753 --> 02:04:29,723
and if they've done anything
bad I tell them where they've gone wrong

2299
02:04:30,059 --> 02:04:30,985
and if they..

2300
02:04:31,793 --> 02:04:32,820
want um..

2301
02:04:33,981 --> 02:04:36,655
what's the word?
not encouragement.. praise

2302
02:04:37,025 --> 02:04:38,186
for what they've done

2303
02:04:38,540 --> 02:04:40,728
then I'll give it to them
if they've done well, yeah

2304
02:04:40,848 --> 02:04:44,633
Do you see maybe your kids
are going to be smarter than you are?

2305
02:04:45,474 --> 02:04:48,958
well, yeah there's a couple of them
already that are gonna be smarter

2306
02:04:49,078 --> 02:04:50,944
How are you going to handle that?

2307
02:04:51,064 --> 02:04:52,176
um...

2308
02:04:52,916 --> 02:04:54,734
I'll keep them on my side

2309
02:04:55,659 --> 02:04:58,134
they say, "where's your father, then?"

2310
02:04:58,254 --> 02:05:01,736
you know, when your mum's out at work
instead of your father

2311
02:05:01,856 --> 02:05:03,823
I just tell'em I ain't got one

2312
02:05:09,309 --> 02:05:10,857
What effect has that had on you?

2313
02:05:13,045 --> 02:05:16,209
well, I don't think it's had any
effect on me because

2314
02:05:18,456 --> 02:05:20,375
what you don't have you don't miss

2315
02:05:21,222 --> 02:05:22,552
twenty years ago

2316
02:05:24,168 --> 02:05:29,267
when I was born, you know, an
illegitimate child that's..

2317
02:05:29,587 --> 02:05:31,722
something that is only whispered about

2318
02:05:31,842 --> 02:05:32,648
people

2319
02:05:32,768 --> 02:05:33,927
you know, feel

2320
02:05:34,213 --> 02:05:36,736
feel strongly about it
in those days but nowadays..

2321
02:05:36,856 --> 02:05:37,647
it's..

2322
02:05:39,885 --> 02:05:41,280
it's not a serious matter

2323
02:05:41,400 --> 02:05:44,781
the serious point is whether you stay
with somebody or you leave them

2324
02:05:44,901 --> 02:05:48,231
What would you like to give your
children that you never had?

2325
02:05:48,351 --> 02:05:49,914
they've got everything

2326
02:05:50,234 --> 02:05:52,417
they've even got what I never had

2327
02:05:52,888 --> 02:05:53,544
so..

2328
02:05:53,664 --> 02:05:55,513
- Which is what?
- a father, isn't it?

2329
02:05:55,633 --> 02:05:57,651
so, I mean, they've had everything

2330
02:05:57,771 --> 02:06:02,119
I feel like bundling when there's
already a.. when there's already a fight

2331
02:06:04,273 --> 02:06:06,983
Simon was brought up in a
children's home.

2332
02:06:07,404 --> 02:06:10,806
He went back to live with
his mother when he was thirteen.

2333
02:06:10,926 --> 02:06:14,071
I was at a boarding school and
I liked the discipline

2334
02:06:14,191 --> 02:06:16,074
it gave me a kind of freedom2

2335
02:06:16,680 --> 02:06:18,430
Do you encourage
that with your children?

2336
02:06:18,550 --> 02:06:21,271
yeah, I like to encourage that, they go
to bed the same time every night

2337
02:06:21,391 --> 02:06:24,652
and they get up round about the
same time every morning

2338
02:06:25,389 --> 02:06:27,560
and they go to school the
same time everyday

2339
02:06:27,680 --> 02:06:30,808
you know, it's good to
have discipline and routine

2340
02:06:31,347 --> 02:06:35,386
But what about in your life? Do
you think there has been too routine?

2341
02:06:35,506 --> 02:06:36,733
no, not really

2342
02:06:36,853 --> 02:06:40,267
I mean, somebody else might think so
yeah but I enjoy

2343
02:06:40,890 --> 02:06:43,768
having a routine and I enjoyed knowing
where I was going to be next

2344
02:06:43,888 --> 02:06:45,687
and what I had to do next

2345
02:06:45,989 --> 02:06:48,966
because that sort of relieved
me from responsibilities

2346
02:06:49,925 --> 02:06:54,116
At 21 he was working in the freezer room
of Wall's Sausages in London.

2347
02:06:55,664 --> 02:06:58,522
How do you see the future?
As far as work goes.

2348
02:06:59,111 --> 02:07:03,318
well, I know I can't stay at Wall's
forever, I mean, this is just not me

2349
02:07:03,670 --> 02:07:06,851
I couldn't stay there for
that long, my mind would go dead

2350
02:07:07,406 --> 02:07:11,022
how long have I been there? about eight
or nine years or something like that

2351
02:07:11,142 --> 02:07:14,725
there's a lot of people I know there now
when I first went there, I mean...

2352
02:07:14,845 --> 02:07:16,358
it's getting to know people, now

2353
02:07:16,478 --> 02:07:19,724
that I've been there so long, I know
practically everybody who's in there

2354
02:07:19,844 --> 02:07:23,275
now I don't think my mind will go dead
because I have a lot to talk about

2355
02:07:23,395 --> 02:07:26,050
everyday go to work,
you know there's always

2356
02:07:26,170 --> 02:07:28,659
somebody says something smart, you know

2357
02:07:29,214 --> 02:07:30,207
someday..

2358
02:07:32,917 --> 02:07:34,937
I'll be just like anybody else

2359
02:07:36,620 --> 02:07:38,503
nothing too marvelous

2360
02:07:39,698 --> 02:07:42,071
I feel okay just getting on with life

2361
02:07:42,340 --> 02:07:44,006
just sort of keeping up

2362
02:07:44,882 --> 02:07:47,775
but I know if I really wanted to
I could get on

2363
02:07:48,263 --> 02:07:51,242
it would only take a little spark
in me to do it

2364
02:07:51,646 --> 02:07:53,615
I'm quite happy to stay there

2365
02:07:54,271 --> 02:07:57,533
doesn't look like it's going
to close down, so, I mean

2366
02:07:58,240 --> 02:08:00,024
better the devil you know, isn't it

2367
02:08:00,144 --> 02:08:03,046
Do you ever feel you should be doing
better jobs than these?

2368
02:08:03,166 --> 02:08:04,595
Aren't you worth more than this?

2369
02:08:04,715 --> 02:08:06,527
no, I haven't really

2370
02:08:06,647 --> 02:08:09,422
I suppose I just like
hard work, I don't know

2371
02:08:09,542 --> 02:08:10,415
but um..

2372
02:08:11,997 --> 02:08:13,406
it's never really

2373
02:08:13,526 --> 02:08:14,954
sort of worried me

2374
02:08:15,459 --> 02:08:17,916
I suppose it should, but it just doesn't

2375
02:08:18,472 --> 02:08:20,693
not really interested in moving up

2376
02:08:20,996 --> 02:08:21,972
up the scale

2377
02:08:22,258 --> 02:08:22,950
why?

2378
02:08:24,683 --> 02:08:26,669
I don't need the hassle of being a

2379
02:08:26,789 --> 02:08:29,025
charger or the manager or whatever

2380
02:08:29,480 --> 02:08:31,196
I had a dream when

2381
02:08:31,316 --> 02:08:34,932
when all the world was on top of me

2382
02:08:35,052 --> 02:08:35,892
and

2383
02:08:36,012 --> 02:08:40,352
and everything was...
and I just about got out

2384
02:08:40,472 --> 02:08:42,514
and everything flew in the air

2385
02:08:43,103 --> 02:08:45,022
and it all landed on my head

2386
02:08:46,133 --> 02:08:48,842
see, I mean everybody's got
the same start

2387
02:08:49,145 --> 02:08:51,602
they've got that little bit of
grey matter in their head

2388
02:08:51,722 --> 02:08:53,663
and it depends how they use it

2389
02:08:54,134 --> 02:08:55,649
and for what purpose

2390
02:08:56,743 --> 02:09:00,866
yeah, if you're just going to be like me
and take it easy for you life

2391
02:09:01,674 --> 02:09:03,841
if you're going to be somebody
who really wants to go far

2392
02:09:03,961 --> 02:09:05,087
well you have to push yourself

2393
02:09:05,509 --> 02:09:07,579
if you don't push yourself,
you won't go up

2394
02:09:07,699 --> 02:09:10,416
And did you want to go far?
Push yourself?

2395
02:09:11,930 --> 02:09:12,772
um...

2396
02:09:13,058 --> 02:09:15,414
no, I want to get
through life nice and easy

2397
02:09:17,232 --> 02:09:21,135
Simon and his family live in a
Council Flat in Southwold, London

2398
02:09:22,935 --> 02:09:25,207
What do you think about rich people?

2399
02:09:25,864 --> 02:09:26,638
well..

2400
02:09:28,171 --> 02:09:29,046
not much

2401
02:09:29,921 --> 02:09:30,965
Tell me about them.

2402
02:09:31,085 --> 02:09:35,105
well they think they can do everything
without you doing it as well

2403
02:09:35,225 --> 02:09:37,916
rich people, they have
all different things

2404
02:09:38,036 --> 02:09:40,657
they have everything they want
whereas poor people

2405
02:09:40,777 --> 02:09:44,494
they don't have nothing
and they know they haven't got nothing

2406
02:09:45,016 --> 02:09:47,692
and so they know
they are missing something

2407
02:09:48,888 --> 02:09:50,537
What are you missing?

2408
02:09:51,379 --> 02:09:53,802
well, I'm missing a bike and

2409
02:09:55,553 --> 02:09:57,000
a fishing rod

2410
02:09:58,313 --> 02:10:01,288
Are you envious of people
who have a lot of money?

2411
02:10:01,408 --> 02:10:03,257
no, I may have been but

2412
02:10:03,377 --> 02:10:05,411
I can't envy them now because

2413
02:10:05,782 --> 02:10:07,328
I've got what I want so

2414
02:10:07,448 --> 02:10:10,678
there's nothing that anyone can give
me that's going to make me any happier

2415
02:10:10,798 --> 02:10:13,506
I could save for months and then
one day just go out and spend it

2416
02:10:13,626 --> 02:10:16,888
and that's that I would
feel quite happy about it

2417
02:10:17,008 --> 02:10:19,834
I wouldn't worry
about getting the next penny

2418
02:10:20,154 --> 02:10:23,433
if you don't plan anything,
you'll never get by anyway

2419
02:10:23,553 --> 02:10:26,445
you could have millions and you
wouldn't know what to do with it

2420
02:10:26,565 --> 02:10:29,374
if you just keep spending it, you have
to know what you are spending

2421
02:10:35,229 --> 02:10:37,232
everybody's gotta get used to

2422
02:10:37,501 --> 02:10:39,201
knowing colored people

2423
02:10:40,009 --> 02:10:42,910
and colored people in turn
have got to get used to

2424
02:10:43,030 --> 02:10:44,710
being with white people

2425
02:10:46,293 --> 02:10:49,154
because if either side
doesn't work properly

2426
02:10:49,274 --> 02:10:51,342
then no side will work properly

2427
02:10:51,661 --> 02:10:54,102
they're just the same as me aren't they?

2428
02:10:54,222 --> 02:10:58,495
I mean, do you think it's hard being
a black man in English society today?

2429
02:10:59,252 --> 02:11:00,969
It depends what you want, isn't it?

2430
02:11:01,089 --> 02:11:04,075
if you just want to life in the
society, no it's not hard

2431
02:11:04,195 --> 02:11:07,508
if you want to fight the society,
yes it would be hard

2432
02:11:07,912 --> 02:11:09,780
And have you ever wanted to fight it?

2433
02:11:09,900 --> 02:11:12,288
not really, no
there's no need for it

2434
02:11:12,408 --> 02:11:15,044
I've been to Madame Tussauds
with my mum

2435
02:11:16,004 --> 02:11:16,997
and the..

2436
02:11:18,528 --> 02:11:19,639
planetarium

2437
02:11:23,796 --> 02:11:25,547
Do you want to go abroad?

2438
02:11:26,490 --> 02:11:27,331
um...

2439
02:11:28,863 --> 02:11:29,587
yeah

2440
02:11:30,580 --> 02:11:32,448
I'd like to go to Majorca

2441
02:11:33,946 --> 02:11:37,022
and take a couple of weeks
out there for everything

2442
02:11:38,452 --> 02:11:39,597
relax myself

2443
02:11:40,236 --> 02:11:43,047
I think I might like to, sort of,
go out of this country

2444
02:11:43,167 --> 02:11:45,134
probably just for a holiday

2445
02:11:45,254 --> 02:11:47,498
first... somewhere... anywhere...

2446
02:11:48,440 --> 02:11:49,905
and then sort of..

2447
02:11:50,662 --> 02:11:51,756
think about

2448
02:11:51,876 --> 02:11:53,464
settling down somewhere else

2449
02:11:53,584 --> 02:11:55,214
I mean, I could have got a job

2450
02:11:55,334 --> 02:11:56,022
in..

2451
02:11:56,561 --> 02:11:57,991
some foreign parts

2452
02:11:58,530 --> 02:12:01,307
working for some an auto.. packing firm

2453
02:12:02,283 --> 02:12:05,339
but when it came down to it I didn't
want to move, I didn't want to leave

2454
02:12:05,459 --> 02:12:06,416
so, I mean

2455
02:12:06,972 --> 02:12:09,025
I've probably got a
very narrow view

2456
02:12:09,145 --> 02:12:11,903
of life because I don't
really like traveling

2457
02:12:13,186 --> 02:12:15,425
Does that worry you that you have that
narrow view? - worry me?

2458
02:12:15,545 --> 02:12:17,781
you keep asking if things worry me, no

2459
02:12:18,656 --> 02:12:20,406
Does it concern you then?

2460
02:12:21,096 --> 02:12:23,082
yeah, that's a different word

2461
02:12:23,520 --> 02:12:25,947
no, not really
it doesn't really concern me

2462
02:12:26,067 --> 02:12:28,017
And what would you want for the future?

2463
02:12:28,137 --> 02:12:30,575
watching my kids growing up and when
they're grown up

2464
02:12:30,695 --> 02:12:33,352
maybe seeing their children
grow up as well

2465
02:12:33,472 --> 02:12:37,696
Looking at some of the earlier films it
would seem that you had a sad childhood.

2466
02:12:37,816 --> 02:12:42,326
You didn't have a dad and you
didn't have a lot of material things.

2467
02:12:42,763 --> 02:12:45,338
no, I wouldn't really
call that a sad life

2468
02:12:45,458 --> 02:12:47,457
it's a different life to
somebody with everything or

2469
02:12:47,577 --> 02:12:50,025
thinks they have
everything but I mean

2470
02:12:50,736 --> 02:12:52,032
it doesn't matter if you've got

2471
02:12:52,419 --> 02:12:55,079
everything, all of the
material things in the world, I mean

2472
02:12:55,199 --> 02:12:58,224
you're not going to be happy anyway
because you'll still want the next thing

2473
02:12:58,344 --> 02:12:59,537
down the road

2474
02:13:08,549 --> 02:13:11,545
At the end of their very
special day in London

2475
02:13:11,665 --> 02:13:14,288
after their trip to the
zoo and the party

2476
02:13:14,810 --> 02:13:17,663
we took our children to
an adventure play ground

2477
02:13:17,783 --> 02:13:20,339
where they could do
just what they liked

2478
02:13:22,485 --> 02:13:25,851
Those from a children's home
set about building a house.

2479
02:13:38,772 --> 02:13:40,152
There's Nicholas.

2480
02:13:46,430 --> 02:13:47,456
And Tony.

2481
02:13:57,194 --> 02:13:58,086
Andrew.

2482
02:14:06,249 --> 02:14:07,090
And Bruce.

2483
02:14:12,964 --> 02:14:13,780
John.

2484
02:14:18,610 --> 02:14:19,368
Suzie.

2485
02:14:22,170 --> 02:14:23,853
Jackie and her friends.

2486
02:14:30,243 --> 02:14:32,583
Give me a child until he is seven...

2487
02:14:32,869 --> 02:14:34,754
and I will give you the man.

2488
02:14:43,707 --> 02:14:46,770
This has been a glimpse
of Britain's future.
